<h2>Help for Port Cable Test</h2>


<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b><EMWEB_IF ID=XUI_IF_STACKING_PRESENT>
	Unit/Slot/Port
<EMWEB_ELSE>
	Slot/Port
</EMWEB_IF></b> -
      This field indicates the interface to which the cable to be tested is connected.  
      </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Cable Test Results</b> 
  <li><b>Cable Status</b> 
      - This displays the cable status as Normal, Open or Short.</li>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Normal</b>: the cable is working correctly.</li>
  <li><b>Open</b>: the cable is disconnected or there is a faulty connector.</li>
  <li><b>Short</b>: there is an electrical short in the cable.</li>
  <li><b>Cable Test Failed</b>: The cable status could not be determined. The cable may in fact be working.
 <BR>This field is displayed after the "Test Cable" button has been clicked and results are available.
<BR>This field is not visible when the page is initially displayed.
      </li>
  </ul>
   <li><b>Cable Length</b> 
      - The estimated length of the cable in meters. The length is displayed as a range 
        between the shortest estimated length and the longest estimated length. 
        Unknown is displayed if the cable length could not be determined. 
        The Cable Length is only displayed if the cable status is Normal. 
        This field is displayed after the "Test Cable" button has been clicked and 
        results are available. 
        This field is not visible when the page is initially displayed.
      </li>
   <li><b>Failure Location</b> 
      - The estimated distance in meters from the end of the cable to the failure location. 
        The failure location is only displayed if the cable status is Open or Short. 
        This field is displayed after the "Test Cable" button has been clicked and results are available. 
        This field is not visible when the page is initially displayed. 
      </li>      
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Command Buttons</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Test Cable </b>
      - Perform a cable test on the selected interface. The cable test may take up 
      to 2 seconds to complete. If the port has an active link then the link is not 
      taken down and the cable status is always "Normal". The command returns a cable
      length estimate if this feature is supported by the PHY for the current link speed.
      Note that if the link is down and a cable is attached to a 10/100 Ethernet 
      adapter then the cable status may be "Open" or "Short" because some Ethernet 
      adapters leave unused wire pairs unterminated or grounded. 
      </li>
