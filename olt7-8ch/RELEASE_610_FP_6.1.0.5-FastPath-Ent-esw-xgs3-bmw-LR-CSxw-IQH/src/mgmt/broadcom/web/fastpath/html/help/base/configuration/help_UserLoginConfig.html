<h2><a name=userlogincfg></a>Help for Configuration User Login</h2>


<P>Each configured user is assigned to a login list that specifies how the user should be authenticated
when attempting to access the switch or a port on the switch.
After creating a new user account on the User Account screen, you should assign that user to a login list
for the switch using this screen and, if necessary, to a login list for the ports using the
Port Access Control User Login Configuration screen.
If you need to create a new login list for the user, you would do so on the Authentication List Configuration page.</P>

<P>The pre-configured users, admin and guest, are assigned to a pre-configured list named defaultList,
which you may not delete.  All newly created users are also assigned to the defaultList until
you specifically assign them to a different list.</P>

<P>A user that does not have an account configured on the switch is termed the 'default' or
'non-configured' user.  If you assign the 'non-configured user' to a login list that specifies
authentication via the RADIUS server, you will not need to create an account for all users
on each switch. However, by default the 'non-configured user' is assigned to 'defaultList', which
by default uses local authentication.</P>

<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>User</b> <!--User-->
  - Select the user you want to assign to a login list.  Note that you must always
  associate the admin user with the default list.  This forces
  the admin user to always be authenticated locally to prevent full lockout from
  switch configuration.
  If you assign a user to a login list that requires remote
  authentication, the user's access to the switch from all CLI, web,
  and telnet sessions will be blocked until the authentication
  is complete. Refer to the discussion of maximum delay in the
  RADIUS configuration help.
  </li>


 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>

  <li><b>Authentication List</b>
  - Select the authentication login list you want to assign to the user for system login.
  </li>

 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Command Buttons </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Submit</b> - Sends the updated screen to the switch and cause the changes to take effect
  on the switch. These changes will not be retained across a power cycle unless you perform a save. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
