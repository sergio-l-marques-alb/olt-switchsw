<h2><a name=servStatsDet></a>Help for Differentiated Services Service Detailed Statistics</h2>

This screen displays class-oriented statistical information for the policy, which is specified by the interface 
and direction. The 'Member Classes' drop down list is populated on the basis of the specified interface and 
direction and hence the attached policy (if any).  Highlighting a member class name displays the statistical 
information for the policy-class instance for the specified interface and direction.
