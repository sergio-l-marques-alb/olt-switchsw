<h2><a name=pbvlan_cfg></a>Help for Protocol-based VLAN Configuration</h2>
<P>
You can use a protocol-based VLAN to define filtering criteria for untagged packets.  By default, if
you do not configure any port- (IEEE 802.1Q) or protocol-based VLANs, untagged packets will be assigned to
VLAN 1. You can override this behavior by defining either port-based VLANs or protocol-based VLANs,
or both.  Tagged packets are always handled according to the IEEE 802.1Q standard, and are not
included in protocol-based VLANs.</P>
<p>
If you assign a port to a protocol-based VLAN for a specific protocol, untagged frames received on
that port for that protocol will be assigned the protocol-based VLAN ID. Untagged frames received on
the port for other protocols will be assigned the Port VLAN ID - either the default PVID (1) or a
PVID you have specifically assigned to the port using the Port VLAN Configuration screen.</P>
<p>
You define a protocol-based VLAN by creating a group. Each group has a one-to-one relationship with
a VLAN ID, can include one to three protocol definitions, and can include multiple ports. When you create a
group you will choose a name and a Group ID will be assigned automatically.</P>

<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Group ID</b> - You can use this screen to reconfigure or delete an existing protocol-based VLAN,
  or create a new one.
  Use this pulldown menu to select one of the existing PBVLANs, or select 'Create New Group' to add a new one.
  A Group ID number will be assigned automatically
         when you create a new group.
         You can create up to 128 groups.
         </li>
 <li><b>Protocol(s)</b> - Select the protocols you want to be associated with the group.
         There are three configurable protocols: IP, IPX, ARP. Hold down the control key to select
         more than one protocol.
          <ul type=square>
         <li><I><b>IP</b></I> -  IP is a network layer protocol that provides a connectionless
                                 service for the delivery of data. </li>
         <li><I><b>ARP</b></I> - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a low-level protocol
                                 that dynamically maps network layer
                                 addresses to physical medium access control (MAC) addresses</li>
         <li><I><b>IPX</b></I> - The Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) is a connectionless
                                 datagram Network-layer protocol that forwards data over a
                                 network. </li>
         </UL>

        </li>
    <li><b><EMWEB_IF ID=XUI_IF_STACKING_PRESENT>
  Unit/Slot/Port
<EMWEB_ELSE>
  Slot/Port
</EMWEB_IF>(s)</b> - Select the interface(s)
         you want to be included in the group.
         Note that a given interface can only belong to one group for a given protocol.
         If you have already added interface 0.1 to a group for IP, you cannot add it to another
         group that also includes IP, although you could add it to a new group for IPX.

  </li>

 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Group Name</b> - Use this field to assign a name to a new group. You may enter up to
        1 to 16 alphanumeric characters including underscores, hyphens and spaces.  </li>
  <li><b>VLAN</b> -
         VLAN can be any number in the range of
         <EMWEB_STRING C='
         return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(1, L7_DOT1Q_MAX_VLAN_ID);
          ' > .
         All the ports in the group will assign this VLAN ID to untagged packets received for the
         protocols you included in this group.
  </li>
 </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Group ID</b> - A number used to identify the group created by the user. Group IDs
         are automatically assigned when a group is created by the user. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Command Buttons</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Submit</b> - Update the switch with the values on this screen.
  If you want the switch to retain the new values across a power cycle, you must perform a save.
</li>
  <li><b>Delete</b> - Remove the Protocol Based VLAN group identified by
         the value in the Group ID field.
         If you want the switch to retain the deletion across a power cycle, you must perform a save.</li>
 </ul>
