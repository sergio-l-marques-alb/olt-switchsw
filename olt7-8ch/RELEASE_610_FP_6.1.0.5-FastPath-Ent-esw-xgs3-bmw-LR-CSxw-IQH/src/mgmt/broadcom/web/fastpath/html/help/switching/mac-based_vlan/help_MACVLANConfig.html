<h2><a name=macvlancfg></a>Help for MAC-based VLAN Configuration</h2>
<P>
MAC-based VLAN feature allows incoming untagged packets to be assigned to a VLAN and thus 
classify traffic based on the source MAC address of the packet.
</P>
<p>
A MAC to VLAN mapping is defined by configuring an entry in the MAC to VLAN
table. An entry is specified via a source MAC address and the desired VLAN ID. The
MAC to VLAN configurations are shared across all ports of the device (i.e. there is a
system wide table that has MAC address to VLAN ID mappings).
</P>
<p>
When untagged or priority tagged packets arrive at the switch and entries exist in the
MAC to VLAN table, the source MAC address of the packet is looked up. If an entry is
found the corresponding VLAN ID is assigned to the packet. If the packet is already
priority tagged it will maintain this value, otherwise the priority will be set to zero. The
assigned VLAN ID is verified against the VLAN table, if the VLAN is valid ingress
processing on the packet continues, otherwise the packet is dropped. This implies that the
user is allowed to configure a MAC address mapping to a VLAN that has not been
created on the system.

<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>MAC Address</b> - Selects the MAC Address bound to a VLAN. To add another 
           MAC VLAN entry, select "Add" option. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>MAC Address</b> - Valid MAC Address which is to be bound to a VLAN ID. This field is 
         configurable only when a MAC-based VLAN is created. </li>
  <li><b>VLAN ID</b> - VLAN ID can be any number in the range of <EMWEB_STRING C='return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(1, L7_DOT1Q_MAX_VLAN_ID);'>. 
  </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Command Buttons</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Submit</b> - Update the switch with the values on this screen. 
  If you want the switch to retain the new values across a power cycle, you must perform a save. 
  </li>
    <li><b>Delete</b> - Delete and entry of MAC Address to VLAN mapping. </li>
</ul>
</ul>
