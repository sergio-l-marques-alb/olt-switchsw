.I PrintPacket 
prints the contents of a buffer in hexadecimal at 16 bytes
per line.  It is called with a pointer to the buffer to be displayed
and the number of bytes that should be displayed out of the buffer.
This call is frequently used in debugging code to display the actual
SNMP message that has been received to allow hand parsing of the 
message.

Returns nothing.

The parameter, 
.I ptr, 
is the buffer that should be printed to the screen.

The parameter, 
.I len, 
indicates how many bytes of the buffer should be
printed to the screen.
.SH EXAMPLES
For an example of how this routine is used, see any of the manager 
utilities.
