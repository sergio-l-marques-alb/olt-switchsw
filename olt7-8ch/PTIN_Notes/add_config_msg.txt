Steps:
1.  Go to Broadcom administration webpage (ip:8080)
      login: admin
      pass:  (none)
2.  Search for the parameter and set a new unique value (e.g. 12345)
3.  Enter CLI through the following command: telnet <card ip> 8023
4.  Enable administration mode and show running config:
      en
      show running-config
5.  Search for the configuration value and use the tag of such
    parameter on the following steps.
6.  Do a full search on the Fastpath project for the above tag.
    You should find a .c file under 'src/mgmt/broadcom/cli/...' that
    contains that tag, particularly a function that is used to set
    that parameter through CLI.
7.  Look inside that function for a 'usmDb' function that actually
    sets the value on the database. Once you found the function, you
    can move to the implementation process.

8.  Look for:
     a) src/application/ptin/ptinHap/CHMessageHandler.c
     b) src/application/ptin/ptinHap/include/CHMessageHandler.h
     c) src/dtl/base/include/dtl_ptin.h
9.  The file 'CHMessageHandler.h' contains the commands' list. Create
    a new one! Please note that commands from OLT start with 0x9---
10. The file 'CHMessageHandler.c' handles the command. Add code for it.
11. The file 'dtl_ptin.h' has several strutures that define different
    payloads for the messages. Create a new one or use an existing one
    if appropriate.

12. Finally, discuss those changes with the Manager staff and get it
    approved.
