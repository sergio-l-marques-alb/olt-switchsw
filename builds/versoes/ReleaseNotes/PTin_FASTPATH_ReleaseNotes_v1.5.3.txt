[Release Notes]
version 1.4.0.a
 - New: Vlan allocation refactored. Instead of picking decremental vlans
        starting from 4092, now groups of vlans are used for each EVC. This
        way, several improvements can be implemented for FFP rules allocation.
 - New: Resources management refactored. FFP rules are limited for QoS, and
        garantees were introduced to be be able to allocate up to 60 unicast/
        /bitstream services. IGMP and DHCP trapping rules were optimized in
        order to save the maximum number of available FFP rules.
 - Fix: Bandwidth profiles were not being removed. Corrected.
version 1.4.0.b
 - Fix: LAG recheck after link-down/link-up, were being made not only to
        bitstream services, but all unicast as well: corrected.
 - Fix: Dynamic Lags were not starting properly after boot-up. A temporary
        solution was found, which by reenabling the LAG interfaces, after
        manager configurations download, the problem stopped to be visible.
        problem 
version 1.4.2
 - Fix: For bitstream services and BW profiles 'NO_FPROFILE', one extra rule
        (in excess) was being created.
 - Fix: Lag Recheck routine improved for tag id changes, without passing through
        the tag id -1 (necessary for static lags).
version 1.4.3
 - New: Protection included in the 'counters at request', to avoid requesting
        simultaneous counting of one ONT client and of its global service.
version 1.4.4
 - Fix: Transmitted packets from processor go at the highest QoS (7) to avoid
        being blocked by higher priority traffic.
version 1.4.5
 - Fix: UTC clock changes, were afecting fastpath timers behavior. Reference
        system clock changed from CLOCK_REALTIME to CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
version 1.5.0
 - New: New message to configure the Access Node Identifier for all client
        circuit id's.
 - Fix: DHCP statistics at client level were not counting for packets rx/tx
        on network ports.
 - Fix: Server packets received on untrusted interfaces were being dropped
        before updating relay agent counters.
version 1.5.1
 - New: Circuit ID syntax rearranged for PT-C. The implemented model, is
        flexible for the slot field value.
 - New: Validations and auto-corrections implemented for the circuit id string.
 - New: Added debug functions to dump and to remove active counters.
 - Fix: Reset Defaults were not clearing active counters (at EVC destruction).
version 1.5.2
 - Fix: DHCP database (with circuit and remote ids) cleared duraing a reset
        defaults.
version 1.5.3
 - New: Added dump routines to verify for existent counters (at request).
 - Fix: Variables initialization were not being done for FFP rules management
        responsible for traffic flowing (bitstream, etc).
