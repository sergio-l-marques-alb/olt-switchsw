[Release Notes]
version 1.2.23
 - Ethernet Statistics: 1519-1522 byte packets included in oversized counting.
version 1.2.24
 - Correction: Interface statistics were not updating rxPackets and rxBytes
   when there is undersize or fragment packets;
 - Correction: Interface statistics were incrementing oversized packets in the
   presence of jabber packets;
 - Correction: 10G Interface statistics were miscalculating dropped packets, by
   not considering packets>MTU with wrong FCS;
 - Correction: Interface statistics were calculating wrongly oversize and
   Pkts1024to1518octet packets returning sometimes negative values;
 - Correction: Interface statistics clearing was not being done properly;
 - New: Interface statistics updating is not done anymore by a periodic task,
   but by direct reading, resulting in a much higher update rate (1-2 seconds).
Version 1.2.25
 - Correction: 10G interface statistics were duplicating number of rx drops.
 - Correction: 10G interface statistics were incrementing both rx and tx drops.
Version 1.2.26
 - Fix: printf messages removed.
version 1.2.27
 - Fix: before EVC creation/reconfiguration, minimum resources are verified
   before proceeding.
 - Fix: Debugtraces cleaning.
version 1.2.28
 - Fix: "Duplicated MAC" alarms were being sent up to three times for each
   effective duplicated MAC.
version 1.3.0
 - MAC flooding flag added for Unicast services to support Single Edge Services.
version 1.3.1
 - Fix: Out of valid memory writing (lagActiveMembers)
 - Fix: Active member alarm converted to Inactive member alarm (open+close).
        An interface that leaves an alarm do not open inactive member alarm.
version 1.3.2
 - New: ERROR_CODE_NOTSUPPORTED=0x000F code error added for not supported QoS
        profiles.
 - Fix: Maximum bandwidth for QoS modified from 10G to 100G, to allow 10G
        profiles to all 8 QoS.
version 1.3.3
 - Fix: Inactive LAG member alarm closed when interface is deactivated, and
        may be reopened when interface is reactivated.
version 1.4.0.a
 - New: Vlan allocation refactored. Instead of picking decremental vlans
        starting from 4092, now groups of vlans are used for each EVC. This
        way, several improvements can be implemented for FFP rules allocation.
 - New: Resources management refactored. FFP rules are limited for QoS, and
        garantees were introduced to be be able to allocate up to 60 unicast/
        /bitstream services. IGMP and DHCP trapping rules were optimized in
        order to save the maximum number of available FFP rules.
 - Fix: Bandwidth profiles were not being removed. Corrected.
