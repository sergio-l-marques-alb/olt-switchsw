[Release Notes]
version 1.2.21
 - Ethernet statistics:
   * Oversized packets should consider all packets with more than 1518 bytes... corrected!
   * Drop Events now includes FCS errors, undersized packets, fragments, jabbers and collisions
   * Throughput now reflects the exact value.
   * Counters Updating periodicity reduced to 5 seconds.
version 1.2.22
 - Ethernet Statistics:
   * Oversized packets over MTU bytes were not being incremented in the 10G interfaces: corrected!
   * Drop events DO NOT include FCS errors, undersized packets, fragments, jabbers and collisions:
     only considers lack of hw resources to process the packet.
   * In order to distinguish discarded ovsersized packets of non discarded (1519 to MTU bytes),
     dropped events are incremented when packet size exceeds the MTU (no resources to process big packets).
version 1.2.23
 - Ethernet Statistics: 1519-1522 byte packets included in oversized counting.
version 1.2.24
 - Correction: Interface statistics were not updating rxPackets and rxBytes
   when there is undersize or fragment packets;
 - Correction: Interface statistics were incrementing oversized packets in the
   presence of jabber packets;
 - Correction: 10G Interface statistics were miscalculating dropped packets, by
   not considering packets>MTU with wrong FCS;
 - Correction: Interface statistics were calculating wrongly oversize and
   Pkts1024to1518octet packets returning sometimes negative values;
 - Correction: Interface statistics clearing was not being done properly;
 - New: Interface statistics updating is not done anymore by a periodic task,
   but by direct reading, resulting in a much higher update rate (1-2 seconds).
Version 1.2.25
 - Correction: 10G interface statistics were duplicating number of rx drops.
 - Correction: 10G interface statistics were incrementing both rx and tx drops.
Version 1.2.26
 - Fix: printf messages removed.
version 1.2.27
 - Fix: before EVC creation/reconfiguration, minimum resources are verified
   before proceeding.
 - Fix: Debugtraces cleaning.
version 1.2.28
 - Fix: "Duplicated MAC" alarms were being sent up to three times for each
   effective duplicated MAC.
version 1.3.0
 - MAC flooding flag added for Unicast services to support Single Edge Services.
version 1.3.1
 - Fix: Out of valid memory writing (lagActiveMembers)
 - Fix: Active member alarm converted to Inactive member alarm (open+close).
        An interface that leaves an alarm do not open inactive member alarm.
version 1.3.2
 - New: ERROR_CODE_NOTSUPPORTED=0x000F code error added for not supported QoS
        profiles.
 - Fix: Maximum bandwidth for QoS modified from 10G to 100G, to allow 10G
        profiles to all 8 QoS.
