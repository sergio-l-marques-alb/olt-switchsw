[Release Notes]
version 1.3.0
 - MAC flooding flag added for Unicast services to support Single Edge Services.
version 1.3.1
 - Fix: Out of valid memory writing (lagActiveMembers)
 - Fix: Active member alarm converted to Inactive member alarm (open+close).
        An interface that leaves an alarm do not open inactive member alarm.
version 1.3.2
 - New: ERROR_CODE_NOTSUPPORTED=0x000F code error added for not supported QoS
        profiles.
 - Fix: Maximum bandwidth for QoS modified from 10G to 100G, to allow 10G
        profiles to all 8 QoS.
version 1.3.3
 - Fix: Inactive LAG member alarm closed when interface is deactivated, and
        may be reopened when interface is reactivated.
version 1.4.0.a
 - New: Vlan allocation refactored. Instead of picking decremental vlans
        starting from 4092, now groups of vlans are used for each EVC. This
        way, several improvements can be implemented for FFP rules allocation.
 - New: Resources management refactored. FFP rules are limited for QoS, and
        garantees were introduced to be be able to allocate up to 60 unicast/
        /bitstream services. IGMP and DHCP trapping rules were optimized in
        order to save the maximum number of available FFP rules.
 - Fix: Bandwidth profiles were not being removed. Corrected.
version 1.4.0.b
 - Fix: LAG recheck after link-down/link-up, were being made not only to
        bitstream services, but all unicast as well: corrected.
 - Fix: Dynamic Lags were not starting properly after boot-up. A temporary
        solution was found, which by reenabling the LAG interfaces, after
        manager configurations download, the problem stopped to be visible.
        problem 
version 1.4.2
 - Fix: For bitstream services and BW profiles 'NO_FPROFILE', one extra rule
        (in excess) was being created.
 - Fix: Lag Recheck routine improved for tag id changes, without passing through
        the tag id -1 (necessary for static lags).
version 1.4.3
 - New: Protection included in the 'counters at request', to avoid requesting
        simultaneous counting of one ONT client and of its global service.
version 1.4.4
 - Fix: Transmitted packets from processor go at the highest QoS (7) to avoid
        being blocked by higher priority traffic.
version 1.4.5
 - Fix: UTC clock changes, were afecting fastpath timers behavior. Reference
        system clock changed from CLOCK_REALTIME to CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
