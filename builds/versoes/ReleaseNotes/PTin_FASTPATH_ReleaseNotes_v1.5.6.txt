[Release Notes]
version 1.4.2
 - Fix: For bitstream services and BW profiles 'NO_FPROFILE', one extra rule
        (in excess) was being created.
 - Fix: Lag Recheck routine improved for tag id changes, without passing through
        the tag id -1 (necessary for static lags).
version 1.4.3
 - New: Protection included in the 'counters at request', to avoid requesting
        simultaneous counting of one ONT client and of its global service.
version 1.4.4
 - Fix: Transmitted packets from processor go at the highest QoS (7) to avoid
        being blocked by higher priority traffic.
version 1.4.5
 - Fix: UTC clock changes, were afecting fastpath timers behavior. Reference
        system clock changed from CLOCK_REALTIME to CLOCK_MONOTONIC.
version 1.5.0
 - New: New message to configure the Access Node Identifier for all client
        circuit id's.
 - Fix: DHCP statistics at client level were not counting for packets rx/tx
        on network ports.
 - Fix: Server packets received on untrusted interfaces were being dropped
        before updating relay agent counters.
version 1.5.1
 - New: Circuit ID syntax rearranged for PT-C. The implemented model, is
        flexible for the slot field value.
 - New: Validations and auto-corrections implemented for the circuit id string.
 - New: Added debug functions to dump and to remove active counters.
 - Fix: Reset Defaults were not clearing active counters (at EVC destruction).
version 1.5.2
 - Fix: DHCP database (with circuit and remote ids) cleared duraing a reset
        defaults.
version 1.5.3
 - New: Added dump routines to verify for existent counters (at request).

        responsible for traffic flowing (bitstream, etc).
version 1.5.4
 - Fix: IGMP single vlan (de)activation was not working (only applied to all).
 - Fix: IGMP timer routines, were using a REALTIME clock. Changed to MONOTNIC
        (osapi.c).
version 1.5.5
 - Fix: IGMP single vlan deactivation, was not removing the correct entries in
        snoopEntriesDoFlush function (snooping_util.c).
version 1.5.6
 - New: Logger libraries included for advanced debugging. IGMP snooping modules
        already use them.
