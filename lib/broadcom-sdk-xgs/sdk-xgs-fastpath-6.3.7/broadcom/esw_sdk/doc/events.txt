*                 Events & their arguments                        *
*******************************************************************

This document comes to describe the events and the meaning of their arguments
to a callback function registered by the application to be notified when one of
these events occurs.
In order to be notified when one of the events described bellow has happened, 
application should use bcm_esw_switch_event_register API to register a callback
function together with a userdata. Same call back function with different
userdata is allowed to be registered. 


The events chip could generate
********************************

BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_IO_ERROR              - Error caused by accesing PCI bus.
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_PARITY_ERROR          - Parity or ECC error during internal memory access.
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_THREAD_ERROR          - Critical error after witch thread must end its life. 
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_ACCESS_ERROR          - Illegal acces to any of internal registers or schan operations.
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_ASSERT_ERROR          - Any time an assert has happened application should be notified. 
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_MODID_CHANGE          - The MODID was changed.
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_DOS_ATTACK            - DOS attack was detected
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_STABLE_FULL           - Warm Boot persistent storage full condition
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_STABLE_ERROR          - Warm Boot data in persistent storage is either corrupt or stale
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_UNCONTROLLED_SHUTDOWN - Warm Boot reinitialization was preceded by a crash
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_WARM_BOOT_DOWNGRADE   - Downgrade was detected during Warm Boot
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_TUNE_ERROR            - Early demand request error event
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_DEVICE_INTERRUPT      - Device interrupt arised
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_ALARM                 - Alarm was generated from EPON chips
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_MMU_BST_TRIGGER       - MMU resource goes over the programmed resource threshold
BCM_SWITCH_EVENT_EPON_ALARM            - Alarm was generated from EPON chips

Registered callback function will take an event type and 3 arguments as parameters 
that mostly should be used by the application to log them and report to Broadcom.
If the registered callback for these types of event been called it is mostly recommended 
to reset the chip, otherwise none of any expected behavior can not be guaranteed.
