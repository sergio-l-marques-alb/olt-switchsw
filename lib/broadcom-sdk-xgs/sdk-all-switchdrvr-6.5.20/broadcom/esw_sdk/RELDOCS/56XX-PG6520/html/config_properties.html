<div class="textblock"><p>Configuration Properties are used by the Broadcom Switching API to customize behavior that must be set before the Switching APIs have been initialized. The configuration properties are generally used to describe aspects of the physical design of the board or to control variations of switch devices that need to be set during initialization.</p>
<p>There are some properties that are used to set defaults for APIs that can then be later changed by using APIs directly. Many of these are historic and will be deprecated in the future. New customer applications should use the APIs to set these controls rather than setting properties. Any properties that will be deprecated in favor of APIs are documented to indicate their state.</p>
<p>Properties are sometimes called Configuration Properties, Config Properties, or SoC Properties. These are just alternate names for the same objects.</p>
<p>Properties can be set using sal_config_set and can be accessed using sal_config_get. These functions provide a database of name=value strings that are used to implement properties.</p>
<p>The Switching API routines that access properties use a set of internal SoC routines (defined in \sc&lt;soc/drv.h&gt;\ec). These routines are built on top of sal_config_get and do a variety of searches for matching string names.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="property_name_searches"></a>
Property Name Searching</h1>
<p>Properties consist of a base property name, an optional object name, and an optional device name. Depending on the type of access method used, a property may be used as a device wide configuration, a per-port configuration, or other object specific configurations. All property lookups are done by searching the property database for a series of entries that start from a specific lookup for the property, object, and device and fall back to more general matches, thus allowing a single property in the database to provide a value for a number of objects and devices, but still allow specific overrides. Each lookup routine is provided with a default value that will be returned if the property lookup does not find any matches.</p>
<p>Every property does device (unit) lookups. The given property name will have the following strings appended to it and a lookup attempted in this order:</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="property_value_decoding"></a>
Property Value Decoding</h1>
<p>Most use cases of properties expect a return value that is an integer. The access routines will parse the value string into an integer. Parsable strings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decimal: [0-9]+</li>
<li>Hexadecimal: 0x[0-9a-f]+</li>
<li>Octal: 0[0-7]+</li>
<li>Binary: 0b[01]+</li>
</ul>
<p>Any number can be negated by preceding it with a "-". Letters in numeric strings are not case sensitive.</p>
<p>Some properties encode a port bitmap value. This is encoded as a hexadecimal number that may be longer than a single word, depending on the width of port bitmaps on the underlying device.</p>
<p>Some properties encode either strings or other data that is sufficiently unusual that it is encoded as a string and is specially parsed in the calling routine. Each individual property will document in its description what non-standard parsing occurs (and therefore what format requirements the string value has).</p>
