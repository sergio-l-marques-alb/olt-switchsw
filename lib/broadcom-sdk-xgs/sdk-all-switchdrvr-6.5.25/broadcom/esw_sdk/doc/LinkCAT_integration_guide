This document outline the steps the users need to take
to link LinkCAT library into the SDK.

We have the ability to link linkCAT library with different 
architectures in the final executable, therefore it is requires 
that separated directories for each architecture exists and the 
linkCAT library place in the correct directory.
 
The following example is for SLK little endian architecture. 

Preparation steps before compiling for SDK with linkCAT library 
distributed as as standalone package 

1. mkdir -p <your path>/build/unix/user/slk
2. mkdir -p <your path>/include
3. cp <path of linkCAT library> <your path>/build/unix/user/slk/.
4. cp <path of linkCat header file> <your path>/include/.
5. Add these lines to your $SDK/make/Make.local
CFGFLAGS += -DPHYMOD_LINKCAT_SUPPORT
CFGFLAGS += -DSERDES_API_FLOATING_POINT
CFLAGS += -I<your path>
PHYMOD_LINKCAT_LIB_PATH=<your path>
6. Compiling images in SDK
cd $SDK/systems/linux/user/slk
make
