/* DMA MANAGER
 *
 * Accepts, buffers, and executes requests for device memory writes, freeing
 * the client from worrying about slabs and other details of DMA.
 * Writes are flushed when the buffers fill up or on g2p3_lpmDmaFlush().
 *
 * ATOMICITY
 *
 * Consider two write requests, w1 and w2, such that g2p3_lpmDmaWrite()
 * of w1 happened BEFORE g2p3_lpmDmaWrite() of w2;
 * then, if level(w2) > level (w1), w2 is guaranteed to be written AFTER w1,
 * and a SYNC is guaranteed between w1 and w2.
