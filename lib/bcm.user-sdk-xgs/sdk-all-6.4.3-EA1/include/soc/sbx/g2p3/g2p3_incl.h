 * This file contains top level includes for g2p3 microcode

 * Mostly, this file is here to break a circularity in inclusion
 * and type definition for the soc_sbx_g2p3_state_t, but
 * it includes files that are indepenent of that definition to
 * allow other files (esp. the generated table definitions) to include
 * only it.
