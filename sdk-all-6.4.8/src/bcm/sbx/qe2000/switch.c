/*
 * Function:

 * Description:
 *      Registers a call back function for switch critical events
 * Parameters:
 *      unit        - Device unit number
 *  cb          - The desired call back function to register for critical events.
 *  userdata    - Pointer to any user data to carry on.
 * Returns:
 *      BCM_E_xxx
 * Notes:
 *      
 *      Several call back functions could be registered, they all will be called upon
 *      critical event. If registered callback is called it is adviced to log the 
 *  information and reset the chip. 
 *  Same call back function with different userdata is allowed to be registered.
