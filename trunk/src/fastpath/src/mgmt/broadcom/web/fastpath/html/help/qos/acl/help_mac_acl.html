<h2><a name=mac_acl_cfg></a>Help for MAC ACL Configuration</h2>

<p>
      A MAC ACL consists of a set of rules which are matched sequentially against a packet.
      When a packet meets the match criteria of a rule, the specified rule action
      (Permit/Deny) is taken and the additional rules are not checked for a match.
      On this menu the interfaces to which an MAC ACL applies must be specified, as well
      as whether it applies to inbound or outbound traffic.  Rules for the MAC ACL are
      specified/created using the MAC ACL Rule Configuration menu.</P>
