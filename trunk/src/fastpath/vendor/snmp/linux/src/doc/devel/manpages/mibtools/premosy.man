.TH PREMOSY SR_CMDMAN "8 May 1996"
.SH NAME
premosy \- preprocessor to convert MIB documents to MOSY input format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B premosy
[
.B inputfile
[
.B outputfile
] ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I premosy
program converts files containing MIB documents (including RFCs and
Internet Drafts available online on the Internet) to a format used by the
.I mosy(SR_CMDMAN)
program.  It does this by removing page markers and text outside of the
ASN.1 specifications which are the core of the MIB document.
.SH "FILES"
If no
.I inputfile
is given or if the
.I inputfile
is `\-'
.I premosy
reads from standard input.
.PP
The 
.I outputfile
should contain the name of the MIB, and the extension should be `.my'.  If no
.I outputfile
is given or if the
.I outputfile
is `\-'
.I premosy
writes to standard output.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.I mosy(SR_CMDMAN),
.I postmosy(SR_CMDMAN),
RFCs 1155, 1157, 1212, and 1902-1908.

.SH BUGS
If the
.I inputfile
contains more than one MIB document, only the first MIB will be
converted and written to the
.I outputfile.
