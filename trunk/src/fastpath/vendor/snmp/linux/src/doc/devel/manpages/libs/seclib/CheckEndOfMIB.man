.SH DESCRIPTION
.I CheckEndOfMIB 
checks to see if every VarBind's type field is
equal to END_OF_MIB_VIEW_EXCEPTION.  This routine is only used
when SNMPv2 or SNMPv2c is defined, and should be called after receving a
SNMP message, calling ParseAuthentication(SR_CLIBMAN), calling ParsePdu(),
and doing some other error checking.  If every VarBind's type field in 
the incoming PDU is equal to END_OF_MIB_VIEW_EXCEPTION, this routine
prints a message and returns \-1.  Otherwise, it returns 0.  If an
error occurs, this routine returns \-2.

Returns \-1 when "End of MIB". 
.br
Returns 0 when not "End of MIB". 
.br
Returns \-2 on error.

The parameter, 
.I pdu_ptr, 
contains the VarBind list that needs to be
checked.  This parameter should have been assigned the value returned by
an earlier call to ParsePdu(SR_CLIBMAN).
.HP 5
.I CheckOID 
is used by the manager utilities to see if the utility should
stop asking for variables. See getmany(SR_CMDMAN), getroute(SR_CMDMAN), and getsub(SR_CMDMAN) 
for examples.

Returns 0 if the utility should continue.
.br
Returns \-1 if the utility should terminate.

The parameter, 
.I oid1_ptr, 
should be the initial OID name requested by
the manager.

The parameter, 
.I oid2_ptr, 
should be the OID name returned in the latest
get-response packet.

.IP Example:  
Say a user used getmany(SR_CMDMAN) to retrieve the system group.  The
getmany(SR_CMDMAN) utility should terminate when the agent returns a variable
not in the system group, like ifNumber.0.
.HP 5
.I CmpOIDClass 
compares the sub-identifiers of the two object 
identifiers (OIDs) passed to it until the length of the smaller OID 
is reached or a sub-identifier for the two OIDs does not match.

Returns 0 if the contents of ptr1 have the same length and values as
the contents of ptr2 (up to the length of the smallest OID).

Returns < 0 if the contents of ptr1 are less than (or "smaller") than
the contents of ptr2.

Returns > 0 if the contents of ptr1 are greater than the contents of
ptr2.

The parameter, 
.I ptr1, 
is one of the OIDs in the comparison.

The parameter, 
.I ptr2, 
is one of the OIDs in the comparison.
.HP 5
.I CmpOID 
compares the sub-identifiers of the two object identifiers
(OIDs) passed to it until the comparison is finished or a 
sub-identifier for the two OIDS does not match.

Returns 0 if contents of ptr1 have the same length and values
as the contents of ptr2.

Returns < 0 if contents of ptr1 are less than (or "shorter") than
the contents of ptr2.

Returns > 0 if contents of ptr1 are greater than (or "longer") than
the contents of ptr2.

The parameter, ptr1, is one of the OIDs in the comparison.

The parameter, ptr2, is one of the OIDs in the comparison.
.HP 5
.I CmpNOID
compares the sub-identifiers of two object identifiers
(OIDs) passed to it in the same way as CmpOID, but only up to a maximum
length indicated by the parameter
.I length.
.SH EXAMPLES
For an example of how these routines are used, see the manager utilities.
