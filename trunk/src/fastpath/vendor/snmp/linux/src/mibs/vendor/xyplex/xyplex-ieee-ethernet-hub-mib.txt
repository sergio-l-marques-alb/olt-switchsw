            3.  Historical Perspective
            
            As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for the 
            Development of Internet Network Management Standards [1], a 
            two-prong strategy for network management of TCP/IP-based 
            internets was undertaken.  In the short-term, the Simple 
            Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in RFC 1067, was 
            to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.  In 
            the long-term, the use of the OSI network management 
            framework was to be examined.  Two documents were produced 
            to define the management information: RFC 1065, which 
            defined the Structure of Management Information (SMI), and 
            RFC 1066, which defined the Management Information Base 
            (MIB).  Both of these documents were designed so as to be 
            compatible with both the SNMP and the OSI network management 
            framework.
            
            This strategy was quite successful in the short-term: 
            Internet-based network management technology was fielded, by 
            both the research and commercial communities, within a few 
            months.  As a result of this, portions of the Internet 
            community became network manageable in a timely fashion.
            
            As reported in RFC 1109, Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network 
            Management Review Group [2], the requirements of the SNMP 
            and the OSI network management frameworks were more 
            different than anticipated.  As such, the requirement for 
            compatibility between the SMI/MIB and both frameworks was 
            suspended.  This action permitted the operational network 
            management framework, based on the SNMP, to respond to new 
            operational needs in the Internet community by producing 
            MIB-II.
            
            In May of 1990, the core documents were elevated to 
            "Standard Protocols" with "Recommended" status.  As such, 
            the Internet- standard network management framework consists 
            of: Structure and Identification of Management Information 
            for TCP/IP-based internets, RFC 1155 [4], which describes 
            how managed objects contained in the MIB are defined; 
            Management Information Base for Network Management of 
            TCP/IP-based internets, which describes the managed objects 
            contained in the MIB, RFC 1156 [5]; and, the Simple Network 
            Management Protocol, RFC 1157 [6], which defines the 
            protocol used to manage these objects.
            
            Consistent with the IAB directive to produce simple, 

            
            
                                                               [Page   3]

            workable systems in the short-term, the list of managed 
            objects defined in the Internet-standard MIB was derived by 
            taking only those elements which are considered essential.  
            However, the SMI defined three extensibility mechanisms: 
            one, the addition of new standard objects through the 
            definitions of new versions of the MIB; two, the addition of 
            widely-available but non- standard objects through the 
            experimental subtree; and three, the addition of private 
            objects through the enterprises subtree.  Such additional 
            objects can not only be used for vendor-specific elements, 
            but also for experimentation as required to further the 
            knowledge of which other objects are essential.
            
            This memo defines extensions to the MIB using the third 
            method.  It contains definitions of managed objects in 
            various Xyplex products, using ASN.1 conventions specified 
            in [10].

            4.  Objects
            
            Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information 
            store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  
            Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract 
            Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In 
            particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an 
            encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an 
            administratively assigned name, which specifies an object 
            type.  The object type together with an object instance 
            serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the 
            object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual 
            string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the 
            object type.
            
            The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data 
            structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 
            language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [4] 
            purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used. 
            These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
            
            The encoding of an object type is simply how that object 
            type is represented using the object type's syntax.  
            Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and 
            encoding is how the object type is represented when being 
            transmitted on the network.
            
            The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of 
            ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by 
            the SNMP.
            
            
            4.1.  Format of Definitions
            
            Section 6 contains the specification of all object types 
            contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined 
            using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the 
            extensions specified in [9].

            5.  Overview
            
            IEEE 802 defines management parameters for Ethernet hubs in 
            [11].  That document is a draft, expected to change, but 
            provides useful guidance in defining a hub MIB.  The Xyplex 
            IEEE 802 Hub MIB is based heavily on that document, but does 
            not implement it exactly.  In particular, IEEE 802 defines 
            the MIB to contain multiple hubs that can contain multiple 
            groups of hub ports.  Xyplex hubs do not support that model, 
            reducing it to a single, scalar instance of hub and group.
            
            The Xyplex IEEE 802 Hub MIB applies to Xyplex systems that 
            act as an Ethernet hub.
            
            The IEEE 802 Hub MIB is mandatory for all Xyplex hubs 
            managed via SNMP.
            
            The MIB comprises functional groups, and each group may in 
            turn contain base objects and tables.
            
            As a convenience to the reader, the groups are:
            
                hmBasicCapability
                hmSelfTestCapability
                hmPerfMonCapability
                hmAddrTrackCapability
                hmBadBitClockCapability
            
            The IEEE MIB contains an additional, optional group, 
            hmGuageCapability, that the Xyplex MIB does not include.
            
            The basic group contains base objects and a port table.  The 
            basic group base objects are:
            
                hubBasicID
                hubGroupCapacity
                hubGroupMap
            
                groupHubBasicID
                groupBasicID
                groupNumberOfPorts
            
            The basic group port table contains:
            
                portHubBasicID
                portGroupBasicId

            
            
                                                               [Page   6]

                hubSelfTestID
                hubResetTimeStamp
                hubHealthState
                hubHealthText
                hubHealthData

                hubResetting
                hubExecutingSelfTest
            
            The performance monitor group contains base objects and a 
            port table.  The base objects are:
            
                relayHubPerfID
                relayPerfID
                relayTotalCollisions
            
            The performance monitor group port table contains:
            
                portHubPerfID
                portGroupPerfID
                portPerfID

                portAutoPartitionCount
            
            The address tracking group has a port table containing:

            The bad bit clock group has a port table containing:
