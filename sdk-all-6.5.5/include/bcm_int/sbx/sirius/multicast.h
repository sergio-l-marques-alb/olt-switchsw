/*
 *  Function
 *    bcm_sirius_multicast_aggregate_create_id
 *  Purpose
 *    Create a specific aggregate group.  This sets up the multicast support
 *    for an aggregate; the caller is still responsible for the squelch table.
 *    Note that aggregates should be configured with override operations below
 *    and have their OI translation disabled.
 *  Arguments
 *    (in) int unit = the unit
 *    (in) uint32 flags = the flags for this group
 *    (in) bcm_multicast_t group = group ID
 *  Return
 *    bcm_error_t cast as int
 *      BCM_E_NONE if successful
 *      BCM_E_* otherwise as appropriate
 *  Notes
 *    We allocate a zero-target MVR to store the logical/physical and source
 *    knockout modes.  It'll be replaced later as needed.
 *
 *    This will balk at creating something in the multicast groups space, and
 *    does not itself manage the system port space, in which it expects to
 *    place aggregates.

 *
 *    Does not care about multiple references to the same target in logical
 *    mode, even if the OIs are identical (allows all).
 *
 *    OI translation in hardware is sticky per target -- if a target already
 *    exists, then its OI translation setting overrides the provided one.  If
 *    not, the provided translation setting is used.
 *

 *  Function

 *  Purpose

 *  Arguments
 *    (in) int unit = the unit
 *    (in) bcm_multicast_t group = group ID
 *    (in) int port_count = number of ports (why can this be negative?)

 *  Return
 *    bcm_error_t cast as int
 *      BCM_E_NONE if successful
 *      BCM_E_* otherwise as appropriate
 *  Notes
 *    port_array and encap_id_array elements are paired 1:1.
 *
 *    Replaces entire existing group contents with new contents, effectively
 *    deleting anything not in the new set.  The API doc doesn't actually *say*
 *    this, but it should.
 *
 *    Somebody should explain why this doesn't take an *unsigned* count.  I
 *    don't see any information about what to do with negative count, so this
 *    implementation will call it BCM_E_PARAM.  Zero count is valid (it just
 *    means there are no replicants in the group).  Yes, you can provide NULL
 *    pointers to the arrays in the case of zero elements.  However, it's
 *    probably more efficient to just call the delete_all function instead.
 *
 *    Wants a BIG pile of stack space (_SHR_PBMP_PORT_MAX * (sizeof(bcm_port_t)
 *    + sizeof(_mc_oitt_elem_internal_t)) so it does not have to do heap
 *    thrashing for resizing data.
 *
 *    Will not allow multiple replicants on same target for physical mode.
 *
 *    The OI translation override can be useful in setting up aggregates in
 *    systems that do use OI translation for multicast but do not need it for
 *    unicast.  OI translation should always be disabled for the entire unit
 *    (improves performance and removes a particular resource limitation) on
 *    systems that do not use OIs for multicast or unicast.  Not sure if
 *    there's any good reason to override in the TRUE direction...
 *
 *    Does not sort the added GPORT,OI tuples in the cache.
 *
 *    Automatically disables OITT for XGS mode higig targets in logical groups;
 *    maintains user statement for OITT mode in all other cases.
