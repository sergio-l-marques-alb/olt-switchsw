lex/flex and yacc/bison:
  Lex and yacc or flex and bison are used for building compilers including
  mibgc, mosy, dl (packlib), mlm script, and policy MIB. The .c files
  generated by lex/yacc and flex/bison include a copyright notice from the
  tool supplier (generally, the OS vendor like Sun, IBM, AT&T, etc). On 
  platforms where we use gnu tools, flex/bison generate a copyright that 
  includes an explicit release from the GNU copyleft use restriction:
     /* As a special exception, when this file is copied by Bison into a
        Bison output file, you may use that output file without restriction.
        This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation
        in version 1.24 of Bison.  */

   You are allowed and encouraged to take this software and build commercial
   products.  However, as a condition of use, you are required to hold 
   harmless all contributors.

  Java products are built using the Sun Java JDK on most platforms. 
  On HP/UX, the Java compiler from HP is used. On AIX, the Java compiler
  from Sun is used.
