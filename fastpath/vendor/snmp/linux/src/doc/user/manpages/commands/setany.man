.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I setany
utility performs a Set request on variables passed to it.
.PP
The arguments to 
.B setany
are:

.IP \-v1\ |\ \-v2c\ |\ \-v3
The SNMP version to use when sending the reqest.
.IP \-ctxid\ contextID
By default, the utility assumes that the response to a request 
should be provided by the agent residing at 
.I agent_addr. 
To send a request in a proxy context, 
use the 
.I \-ctxid\ contextID 
argument to specify the 
.I snmpEngineID 
of the agent that should provide the response. The 
.I contextID 
(
.I snmpEngineID
) is a printable ASCII string.
.IP \-ctx\ contextName
By default, the utility sends all requests in the "default" context. 
To send a request in a different context, 
The 
.I \-ctx\ contextName 
argument specifies the context of the response. The 
.I contextName
is a printable ASCII string.
.IP \-d
The
.I -d
argument turns on message logging.
When this feature is selected, the utility prints messages
containing important information at milestone points of execution,
and this is useful for problem diagnosis.
.IP \-timeout\ seconds
By default, the utility will wait a total of ten(10) seconds
to receive a response from an SNMP agent.  If no response
is received within that timeout period, the utility may
try again to send the request.  The
.I \-timeout\ seconds
(or
.I \-t\ seconds
)
argument can be used to change the
length of the timeout period where `seconds' is the time
in seconds.
.IP \-retries\ number \
By default, if the utility receives no response from the
SNMP agent, it will try again five(5) more times to send the
request.  The
.I \-retries\ number \ 
(or
.I \-r\ number \
)
argument can be used to change the number of times the
utility will send the request where `number' is the number
of retries.
.IP \-pkt_size\ number \ 
By default, the utility will not transmit an SNMP request or receive an SNMP notification if the Basic Encoding Rules-encoded length of the packet exceeds 2048 bytes. The 
.B -pkt_size\ number \  
argument can be used to set the maximum supported packet size for all SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3 messages to 
.B "number" 
bytes. The value of 
.B number
must be in the range from 484 to 2147483647.

After the previous arguments have been specified, the following arguments should be provided. Unlike the previous arguments, it is important to use the following arguments in order. 
.IP agent_addr
The address of the SNMP agent.
.IP community|userName
Either an SNMPv2C community string or an SNMPv3 user name. 
.in +4

.IP variable 
The name of the variable to set.

.IP type
Indicates the type of the variable to set. One of the following types:

.in +4
 \-b \ - bit string        
 \-i \- integer
 \-o \- octet
 \-d \- object identifier
 \-a \- ip_addr
 \-c \- counter
 \-g \- gauge
 \-t \- time_ticks
 \-D \- Display String
 \-N \- NULL
 \-T \- DateAndTime
.in -4

.IP value
The desired value to store in the variable.
.IP
.I Note:\ type
is an optional field for all but
.I \-D 
(Display String).  The type may still be put on the command line, but it is
only necessary in the case of display strings.
.IP
.I Note:
if
.I type
is
.I \-N
(NULL), the
.I value
field is ignored but must be present.  Use `0'.

.SH EXAMPLES
For
.I setany
to succeed, the variable's MAX-ACCESS as defined by the MIB must be
read\-write (or read\-create), and the userName or community string must
be authorized to perform a Set request on the indicated variable.
.PP
In the following example, the SNMPv1 community string `public' is
authorized to get the value of sysContact.0 but is not authorized to
set the value:

.in+4
.nf
% getone -v1 localhost public sysContact.0
sysContact.0 = SNMP Research, Inc.  (865) 573-1434
% setany -v1 localhost public sysContact.0 -D "support@snmp.com"
Error code set in packet - No such variable name.  Index:  1.
.fi
.in-4

.PP
In the following example, the SNMPv2c community string "public" 
is authorized to get the value of sysContact.0 but is not 
authorized to set the value:

.in+4
.nf
%  getone  -v2c  localhost  public  sysContact.0
sysContact.0  =  SNMP  Research,  Inc.   (865)  573-1434
%  setany  -v2c  localhost  public  sysContact.0  -D  "support@snmp.com"
Error  code  set  in  packet  -  NO_ACCESS_ERROR:  1.
.fi
.in-4

.PP
In the following example, the SNMPv3 user, public, is not authorized
to send Set requests to this SNMP entity but can Get the value of
sysContact.0:

.in+4
.nf
%  getone  -v3  localhost  public sysContact.0
Enter  Authentication  password  :
sysContact.0  =  SNMP  Research,  Inc.   (865)  573-1434
%  setany  -v3  localhost  public sysContact.0  -D  "support@snmp.com"
Enter  Authentication  password  :
Error  code  set  in  packet  -  NO_ACCESS_ERROR:  1.
.fi
.in-4

.PP
In the following example, the variable is sysContact.0 and the
SNMPv3 user is HelpDesk.  This user is authorized to send Set
requests to this SNMP entity, but the variable is not in the user's
MIB view for Get or Set requests:

.in+4
.nf
%  getone  -v3  localhost  HelpDesk sysContact.0
Enter  Authentication  password  :
Error  code  set  in  packet  -  AUTHORIZATION_ERROR:  1.
%  setany  -v3  localhost  HelpDesk sysContact.0  -D  "support@snmp.com"
Enter  Authentication  password  :
Error  code  set  in  packet  -  AUTHORIZATION_ERROR:  1.
.fi
.in-4

.PP
In the following example, the SNMPv3 user is DayOperator.  This user is 
authorized to send Set requests to this SNMP entity, and the user's MIB 
view for Get and for Set requests includes both sysContact.0 and sysDescr.0.  
The value of sysDescr.0 can not be set because the variable's MAX-ACCESS 
as defined by the MIB is read-only:

.in+4
.nf
%  getone  -v3  localhost  DayOperator sysContact.0  sysDescr.0
Enter  Authentication  password  :
sysContact.0  =  SNMP  Research,  Inc.   (865)  573-1434
sysDescr.0  =  SNMPv3  agent  from  SNMP  Research,  Inc.
%  setany  -v3  localhost  DayOperator sysContact.0  -D  "support@snmp.com"
Enter  Authentication  password  :
sysContact.0  =  support@snmp.com
%  setany  -v3  localhost  DayOperator sysDescr.0  -D  "SNMPv3  agent"
Enter  Authentication  password  :
Error  code  set  in  packet  -  NOT_WRITABLE_ERROR:  1.
.fi
.in-4

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affects the behavior of
.I setany.
.IP SR_MGR_CONF_DIR
This variable changes the location where
.I setany
expects to find the configuration files mgr.cnf and snmpinfo.dat.
Normally this location is /etc/srconf/mgr/.
.IP SR_SNMP_TEST_PORT
This variable changes the UDP port where
.I setany
sends SNMP requests (normally 161).
.IP SR_UTIL_SNMP_VERSION
This variable sets the default SNMP version to use for all
subsequent requests.  The value of this environment variable
may be `-v1', `-v2c', or `-v3'.  If this variable is set, the
user does not need to specify
.I \-v1,
.I \-v2c,
or
.I \-v3
on the command line.
.IP SR_UTIL_COMMUNITY
This variable sets the default community string for all subsequent
SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C requests.  If this variable is set, the user does
not need to specify a community string on the command line for SNMPv1
and SNMPv2C requests.
.IP SR_UTIL_USERNAME
This variable sets the default user name for all subsequent
SNMPv3 requests.  If this variable is set, the user does not need to
specify a his or her user name on the command line for SNMPv3 requests.
.IP SR_UTIL_AUTH_PASSWORD
This variable sets the authentication password for all subsequent
requests.  If this variable is set to the NULL string, the user
will not be prompted for a password and a request with no authentication
and no privacy will be sent; otherwise, the user will be prompted
only for a privacy password.
.IP SR_UTIL_PRIV_PASSWORD
This variable sets the privacy password for all subsequent requests.
If SR_UTIL_AUTH_PASSWORD is not set, this variable is ignored.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP Cannot\ translate\ MIB\ variable:
This message indicates that the
.I snmpinfo.dat(SR_FMTMAN)
configuration file does not contain OID translation information for
the indicated MIB variable's English name.
.IP Failure\ in\ snmpinfo.dat
This message indicates that there is a problem with the named
configuration file.  Check to see that there is an
.I snmpinfo.dat(SR_FMTMAN)
file located in the default directory
or in the directory indicated by the environment variable
SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.  If the file exists, ensure that the file
is readable and contains the correct information.
