.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I inform
utility 
program illustrates how to send InformRequest PDUs.  It is only meant
as an example and does not actually use the Manager to Manager MIB.  
This example sends the InformRequest
PDU and then waits for a response.  If it receives a response, the response
is printed out and the program exits.  Otherwise, the program tries to
resend the PDU until either it gets a response or the maximum number of
.I retries
is reached. 
The
.I inform
utility is available for ARL, BRASS, and EPIC products



The arguments are:
.IP \-v1\ |\ \-v2c\ |\ \-v3
The SNMP version to use when sending the reqest.
.IP \-ctxid\ contextID
By default, the utility assumes that the response to a request 
should be provided by the agent residing at 
.I agent_addr. 
To send a request in a proxy context, 
use the 
.I \-ctxid\ contextID 
argument to specify the 
.I snmpEngineID 
of the agent that should provide the response. The 
.I contextID 
(
.I snmpEngineID
) is a printable ASCII string.
.IP \-ctx\ contextName
By default, the utility sends all requests in the "default" context. 
To send a request in a different context, 
The 
.I \-ctx\ contextName 
argument specifies the context of the response. The 
.I contextName
 is a printable ASCII string.
.IP \-d
The
.I -d
argument turns on message logging.
When this feature is selected, the utility prints messages
containing important information at milestone points of execution,
and this is useful for problem diagnosis.
.IP \-timeout\ seconds
By default, the utility will wait a total of ten(10) seconds
to receive a response from an SNMP agent.  If no response
is received within that timeout period, the utility may
try again to send the request.  The
.I \-timeout\ seconds
(or
.I \-t\ seconds
)
argument can be used to change the
length of the timeout period where `seconds' is the time
in seconds.
.IP \-retries\ number
By default, if the utility receives no response from the
SNMP agent, it will try again five(5) more times to send the
request.  The
.I \-retries\ number
(or
.I \-r\ number
)
argument can be used to change the number of times the
utility will send the request where `number' is the number
of retries.
.IP \-pkt_size number
 By default, the utility will not transmit an SNMP request or receive an SNMP notification if the Basic Encoding Rules-encoded length of the packet exceeds 2048 bytes. The 
.B -pkt_size number 
argument can be used to set the maximum supported packet size for all SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3 messages to 
.b "number" 
bytes. The value of 
.b number
 must be in the range from 484 to 2147483647.

After the previous arguments have been specified, the following arguments should be provided. Unlike the previous arguments, it is important to use the following arguments in order. 
.IP dst_addr
The destination of the Inform request.
.IP community|userName
Either an SNMPv2C community string or an SNMPv3 user name. 
.IP informName
The event's ID, an instance-level object identifier.
.IP informValue
The event's value, an object identifier.
.IP variable_name\ type\ value
.in +4

.I variable:
the name of a variable in the inform's VarBind list.

.I type:
one of:

.in +4
 \-i \- integer,
 \-o \- octet,
 \-d \- object identifier
 \-a \- ip_addr
 \-c \- counter
 \-g \- gauge
 \-t \- time_ticks
 \-D \- Display String
 \-N \- NULL
 \-T \- DateAndTime
.in -4

.I value:
the desired value.
.IP
.I Note:\ type
is an optional field for all but
.I \-D 
(Display String).  The type may still be put on the command line, but it is
only necessary in the case of display strings.
.IP
.I Note:
if
.I type
is
.I \-N
(NULL), the
.I value
field is ignored but must be present.  Use `0'.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following request will send an Inform request and wait for 
the receiver to send back an acknowledgement (ACK):

.in+4
.nf
% inform -v2c -retries 4 -timeout 1 localhost public \\
surgeBreakerAlarm 0.0 surgeBreakerStatus.0 -i unknown
.fi
.in-4

After waiting a certain amount of time (or.I timeout), the PDU
will be sent again.  This cycle will repeat until either an ACK is
received or the maximum number of
.I retries
is reached (in this case 4).

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affects the behavior of
.I inform.
.IP SR_MGR_CONF_DIR
This variable changes the location where
.I inform
expects to find the configuration files mgr.cnf and snmpinfo.dat.
Normally this location is /etc/srconf/mgr/.
.IP SR_SNMP_TEST_PORT
This variable changes the UDP port where
.I inform
sends SNMP requests (normally 161).
.IP SR_UTIL_SNMP_VERSION
This variable sets the default SNMP version to use for all
subsequent requests.  The value of this environment variable
may be `-v1', `-v2c', or `-v3'.  If this variable is set, the
user does not need to specify
.I \-v1,
.I \-v2c,
or
.I \-v3
on the command line.
.IP SR_UTIL_COMMUNITY
This variable sets the default community string for all subsequent
SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C requests.  If this variable is set, the user does
not need to specify a community string on the command line for SNMPv1
and SNMPv2C requests.
.IP SR_UTIL_USERNAME
This variable sets the default user name for all subsequent
SNMPv3 requests.  If this variable is set, the user does not need to
specify a his or her user name on the command line for SNMPv3 requests.
.IP SR_UTIL_AUTH_PASSWORD
This variable sets the authentication password for all subsequent
requests.  If this variable is set to the NULL string, the user
will not be prompted for a password and a request with no authentication
and no privacy will be sent; otherwise, the user will be prompted
only for a privacy password.
.IP SR_UTIL_PRIV_PASSWORD
This variable sets the privacy password for all subsequent requests.
If SR_UTIL_AUTH_PASSWORD is not set, this variable is ignored.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP Cannot\ translate\ MIB\ variable:
This message indicates that the
.I snmpinfo.dat(SR_FMTMAN)
configuration file does not contain OID translation information for
the indicated MIB variable's English name.
.IP Failure\ in\ snmpinfo.dat
This message indicates that there is a problem with the named
configuration file.  Check to see that there is an
.I snmpinfo.dat(SR_FMTMAN)
file located in the default directory
or in the directory indicated by the environment variable
SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.  If the file exists, ensure that the file
is readable and contains the correct information.

.SH LIMITATIONS
This utility only works with SNMPv2C/SNMPv2*.  There is no
corresponding SNMPv1 utility.
