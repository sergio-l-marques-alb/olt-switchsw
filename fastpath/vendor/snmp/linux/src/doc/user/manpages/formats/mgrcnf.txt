NAME
     mgr.cnf - SNMP manager configuration


SYNOPSIS
     TAG VALUE


DESCRIPTION
     The mgr.cnf file is used to  configuration  information  for
     SNMPv2* users.  The default location of snmpd.cnf is

         /etc/srconf/mgr/                     UNIX
         \ETC\SRCONF\MGR\ (current drive)     MS-DOS

     but this location can be changed by assigning the full path-
     name   of   a   directory   to   the   environment  variable
     SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.

     The format of mgr.cnf is

     TAG VALUE

     where TAG is `userNameEntry' and the  format  of  the  VALUE
     clause is

          userAuthSnmpID userName userGroupName  userTransportLa-
          bel userMemoryType

     where

        + userAuthSnmpID
          is an OctetString which is the authSnmpID of the  agent
          on  which  this user exists.  If the user is authorized
          to access more than one agent, this field will be  dif-
          ferent for each agent.

        + userName
          is the user name in ASCII text.

        + userGroupName
          is the user's group name in ASCII text.

        + userTransportLabel
          is ignored.

        + userMemoryType
          is `nonVolatile', `permanent', or `readOnly'.
