.TH GETMET SR_CMDMAN "15 April 2003"

.SH NAME
getmet \- extract routing information from an SNMP entity.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B \-ctxid\ contextID
] [

.B agent_addr
.B userName|community
[
.B subnet
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I getmet 
utility 
is an SNMP application that retrieves routing information from
an entity by traversing the ipRouteDest, ipRouteMetric1,
ipRouteMetric2, ipRouteMetric3, and ipRouteMetric4 variable classes
for each subnet found. 
The 
.I getmet 
utility is not available for EPIC or Security Pack.
.PP
The arguments to 
.I getmet
are:
.IP \-v1\ |\ \-v2c\ |\ \-v3
The SNMP version to use when sending the reqest.
.IP \-ctxid\ contextID
By default, the utility assumes that the response to a request 
should be provided by the agent residing at 
.I agent_addr. 
To send a request in a proxy context, 
use the 
.I \-ctxid\ contextID 
argument to specify the 
.I snmpEngineID 
of the agent that should provide the response. The 
.I contextID 
(
.I snmpEngineID
) is a printable ASCII string.
.IP \-ctx\ contextName
By default, the utility sends all requests in the "default" context. 
To send a request in a different context, 
The 
.I \-ctx\ contextName 
argument specifies the context of the response. The 
.I contextName
is a printable ASCII string.
.IP \-d 
The
.I -d
argument turns on message logging.
When this feature is selected, the utility prints messages
containing important information at milestone points of execution,
and this is useful for problem diagnosis.
.IP \-timeout\ seconds
By default, the utility will wait a total of ten(10) seconds
to receive a response from an SNMP agent.  If no response
is received within that timeout period, the utility may
try again to send the request.  The
.I \-timeout\ seconds
(or
.I \-t\ seconds
)
argument can be used to change the
length of the timeout period where `seconds' is the time
in seconds.
.IP \-retries\ number
By default, if the utility receives no response from the
SNMP agent, it will try again five(5) more times to send the
request.  The
.I \-retries\ number
(or
.I \-r\ number
)
argument can be used to change the number of times the
utility will send the request where `number' is the number
of retries.
.IP \-pkt_size\ number
By default, the utility will not transmit an SNMP request or receive an SNMP notification if the Basic Encoding Rules-encoded length of the packet exceeds 2048 bytes. The 
.B \-pkt_size number\ 
argument can be used to set the maximum supported packet size for all SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and SNMPv3 messages to 
.B `number'
bytes. The value of 
.B number
must be in the range from 484 to 2147483647.

After the previous arguments have been specified, the following arguments should be provided. Unlike the previous arguments, it is important to use the following arguments in order. 
.IP agent_addr
The address of the SNMP agent.
.IP community|userName
Either an SNMPv1/SNMPv2C community string or an SNMPv3 user name. 
.IP subnet
A partial IP address.  This value is interpreted as first octet(s)
of the IP address.  In other words "128" will match addresses
128.xxx.xxx.xxx, but not addresses with xxx.128.xxx.xxx or
xxx.xxx.128.xxx, etc.  Only those portions of the routing table
which match the
.I subnet
address qualifier are retrieved.
.PP
If no subnet is
specified, the behavior is the same as a 
.I getroute(SR_CMDMAN).

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following requests would retrieve all entries beginning with 192.244. 

.in+4
getmet -v1 myagent public 192.244

getmet -v2c myagent public 192.244

getmet -v3 myagent DayOperator 192.244
.in-4

Similarly, the following requests would retrieve all entries 
beginning with 128.139.4. 

.in+4
getmet -v1 myagent public 128.139.4

getmet -v2c myagent public 128.139.4

getmet -v3 myagent DayOperator 128.139.4
.in-4

Finally, the following requests would retrieve the entire 
routing table (operating just like getroute(SR_CMDMAN)).

.in+4
getmet -v1 myagent public

getmet -v2c myagent public

getmet -v3 myagent DayOperator 
.in-4


.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable affects the behavior of
.I getmet.
.IP SR_MGR_CONF_DIR
This variable changes the location where
.I getone
expects to find the configuration files mgr.cnf and snmpinfo.dat.
Normally this location is /etc/srconf/mgr/.
.IP SR_UTIL_SNMP_VERSION
This variable sets the default SNMP version to use for all
subsequent requests.  The value of this environment variable
may be `-v1', `-v2c', or `-v3'.  If this variable is set, the
user does not need to specify
.I \-v1,
.I \-v2c,
or
.I \-v3
on the command line.
.IP SR_UTIL_COMMUNITY
This variable sets the default community string for all subsequent
SNMPv1 and SNMPv2C requests.  If this variable is set, the user does
not need to specify a community string on the command line for SNMPv1
and SNMPv2C requests.
.IP SR_UTIL_USERNAME
This variable sets the default user name for all subsequent
SNMPv3 requests.  If this variable is set, the user does not need to
specify a his or her user name on the command line for SNMPv3 requests.
.IP SR_UTIL_AUTH_PASSWORD
This variable sets the authentication password for all subsequent
requests.  If this variable is set to the NULL string, the user
will not be prompted for a password and a request with no authentication
and no privacy will be sent; otherwise, the user will be prompted
only for a privacy password.
.IP SR_UTIL_PRIV_PASSWORD
This variable sets the privacy password for all subsequent requests.
If SR_UTIL_AUTH_PASSWORD is not set, this variable is ignored.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP Failure\ in\ snmpinfo.dat
This message indicates that there is a problem with the named
configuration file.  Check to see that there is an
.I snmpinfo.dat(SR_FMTMAN)
file located in the default directory
or in the directory indicated by the environment variable
SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.  If the file exists, ensure that the file
is readable and contains the correct information.
