.TH TRAPRCV SR_CMDMAN "21 May 2003"

.SH NAME
traprcv \- receive traps from remote SNMP trap\-generating entities

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B traprcv
[
.B \-d
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I traprcv
utility 
is a program which receives traps from remote SNMP trap\-generating entities.
It binds to the SNMP trap port 162 (UDP) to listen for the traps, and thus
must be run as root.  It prints to standard output messages
about the traps it has received.  The primary purpose of this program is to
demonstrate how traps are parsed using the SNMP library.

There is only one option to 
.I traprcv:
.IP \-d
The
.I -d
argument turns on message logging.
When this feature is selected, the utility prints messages
containing important information at milestone points of execution,
and this is useful for problem diagnosis.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affects the behavior of
.I traprcv.
.IP SR_MGR_CONF_DIR
This variable changes the location where
.I traprcv
expects to find the configuration file snmpinfo.dat.
Normally this location is /etc/srconf/mgr/.
.IP SR_SNMP_TEST_PORT
This variable changes the UDP port where other SNMP Research utilities
send SNMP requests (normally 161).  This variable also affects the UDP
port where
.I traprcv
receives SNMP traps (normally 162).  When this environment variable is
set, the default trap port number is one greater
than the value of this environment variable.
.IP SR_TRAP_TEST_PORT
This variable changes the UDP port where
.I traprcv
receives SNMP traps (normally 162).  This variable takes precedence over
SR_SNMP_TEST_PORT.

.SH FILES
 /etc/srconf/mgr/snmpinfo.dat

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP Failure\ in\ snmpinfo.dat
This message indicates that
there is a problem with the named configuration file.  Check to see
that there is an snmpinfo.dat file located in the default directory
or in the directory indicated by the environment variable
SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.  If the file exists, ensure that the file
is readable and contains the correct information.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.nf
Only works on UNIX machines.
Must be run as root.
