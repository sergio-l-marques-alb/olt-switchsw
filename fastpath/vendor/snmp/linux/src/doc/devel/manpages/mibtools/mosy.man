.TH MOSY SR_CMDMAN "8 May 1996"

.SH NAME
mosy - Managed Object Syntax-compiler (yacc-based)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.in +.5i
.ti -.5i
.B mosy

\%[\-o\0module.defs]

.in -.5i

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fImosy\fR program reads a description of a \fImanaged objects\fR
module and produces a simple ascii file containing equivalent definitions.
This file is meant to be read as configuration data by a network
management program.
.PP
The `\-d' switch directs \fImosy\fR to check for duplicate type definitions.
.PP
The `\-i' switch directs \fImosy\fR to ignore any errors encountered.
.PP
The `\-o' switch sets the name of the output file,
which is normally derived from the name of the input file.
The distinguished file \*(lq\-\*(rq can be used to force the use of the
standard output.
.PP
Normally, \fImosy\fR prints the name of each object, identifier, or type
as it works.
The `\-s' switch disables this behavior.
.PP
The `\-t' switch directs \fImosy\fR to generate a directive file used by
the snmptcl interpreter.
.PP
The `\-1' switch tells \fImosy\fR to generate an SNMPv1-compliant MIB module,
if possible,
from the SNMPv2-compliant MIB module supplied as input.
In contrast,
the `\-h' switch directs \fImosy\fR to generate an HTML file
containing the MIB definition.
These options are mutually-exclusive.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.I premosy(SR_CMDMAN),
.I postmosy(SR_CMDMAN),
.I mgrtool(SR_CMDMAN),
RFCs 1155, 1212, and 1902-1904.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP value\ of\ STATUS\ clause\ isn't\ a\ valid\ keyword
This message indicates that there is a problem with the input MIB.
SNMPv1 MIBs should IMPORT RFC1155-SMI.  SNMPv2 MIBs should IMPORT
SNMPv2-SMI.  This message can occur if the incorrect
Structure of Management Information document is referenced.
.IP INTEGER\ requires\ either\ upper\-lower\ bounds\ ...
\ ... or named\-number enumerations.
This message indicates that there is a problem with the input MIB.
SNMPv2 MIBs require that INTEGER objects be defined with a range value
such as `SYNTAX INTEGER (1..1000)' or an enumerated value such as
`SYNTAX INTEGER { go(1), stop(2), asleep(3), dead(4), other(5) }'.
SNMPv2 MIBs should IMPORT SNMPv2-SMI.  This message can occur if
the RFC1155-SMI document is referenced instead of SNMPv2-SMI.

.SH LIMITATIONS
\fImosy\fR does not maintain a library,
so it can't check IMPORT statements for their validity.
