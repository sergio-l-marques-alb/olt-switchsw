MOSY(l)           MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES            MOSY(l)



NAME
     mosy - Managed Object Syntax-compiler (yacc-based)

SYNOPSIS
     mosy [-d] [-i] [-o module.defs] [-s] [-t] [-1] [-h]
          module.my


DESCRIPTION
     The mosy program reads a description of  a  managed  objects
     module   and   produces   a  simple  ascii  file  containing
     equivalent definitions.  This file is meant to  be  read  as
     configuration data by a network management program.

     The `-d' switch directs mosy to  check  for  duplicate  type
     definitions.

     The `-i' switch directs mosy to ignore  any  errors  encoun-
     tered.

     The `-o' switch sets the name of the output file,  which  is
     normally  derived from the name of the input file.  The dis-
     tinguished file "-" can be used to  force  the  use  of  the
     standard output.

     Normally, mosy prints the name of each  object,  identifier,
     or  type  as  it  works.   The  `-s'  switch  disables  this
     behavior.

     The `-t' switch directs mosy to generate  a  directive  file
     used by the snmptcl interpreter.

     The `-1' switch tells mosy to generate  an  SNMPv1-compliant
     MIB  module,  if  possible,  from  the  SNMPv2-compliant MIB
     module supplied as input.   In  contrast,  the  `-h'  switch
     directs  mosy  to  generate  an HTML file containing the MIB
     definition.  These options are mutually-exclusive.

DIAGNOSTICS
     value of STATUS clause isn't a valid keyword
          This message indicates that there is a problem with the
          input  MIB.   SNMPv1  MIBs  should  IMPORT RFC1155-SMI.
          SNMPv2 MIBs should IMPORT SNMPv2-SMI.  This message can
          occur if the incorrect Structure of Management Informa-
          tion document is referenced.

     INTEGER requires either upper-lower bounds ...
           ... or named-number enumerations.  This message  indi-
          cates  that  there  is  a  problem  with the input MIB.
          SNMPv2 MIBs require that  INTEGER  objects  be  defined
          with  a  range value such as `SYNTAX INTEGER (1..1000)'
          or an enumerated value such as `SYNTAX INTEGER { go(1),
          stop(2),  asleep(3), dead(4), other(5) }'.  SNMPv2 MIBs
          should IMPORT SNMPv2-SMI.  This message  can  occur  if
          the  RFC1155-SMI  document  is  referenced  instead  of
          SNMPv2-SMI.


LIMITATIONS
     mosy does not maintain a library, so it can't  check  IMPORT
     statements for their validity.
