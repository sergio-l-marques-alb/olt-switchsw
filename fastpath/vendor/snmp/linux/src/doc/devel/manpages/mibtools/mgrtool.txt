NAME
     mgrtool - MOSY post processor for managers


SYNOPSIS
     mgrtool [ -o base | -f configfile ] [ options ... ] [  *.def
     ]

     mgrtool [ -o base ] [ -inputinfo ] [ *info.dat ]

     mgrtool [ -mergeinfo ] [ *info.dat ]


DESCRIPTION
     The mgrtool program reads the concatenated output of mosy(l)
     and generates several files used for developing SNMP compli-
     ant managers.  Files generated by mosy(l) (which  are  input
     files  to  mgrtool  )  end with the extension `.def'.  Zero,
     one, or many .def files may be supplied on the command line.
     If  no  .def  files  are  given  mgrtool reads from standard
     input.

     Using  all  of  the  default  settings,  mgrtool   generates
     snmpinfo.dat  and snmp-mib.h.  The snmpinfo.dat file is used
     by SNMP Research Utilities  and  other  management  applica-
     tions.

     All files generated by mgrtool  have  a  common  base  name,
     which is `snmp' by default but can be changed.

OPTIONS
     -c string
          Provide one line of configuration  information  on  the
          command  line.   The contents of string may be the same
          as any one line of configfile (refer to the -f option).
          This  method  of  configuration  can be used to compile
          only selected portions of the MIB.  This option  should
          not be used together with the -f or -o options.

     -f configfile
          Read configuration information  from  configfile.  This
          method  of  configuration  can  be used to compile only
          selected portions of the MIB, or it can be used to dis-
          tribute  output across multiple sets of files with dif-
          ferent base  names.   Because  the  configuration  file
          specifies  a  base  name  for output files, this option
          should not be used together with the -c or -o options.

     -inputinfo
          Read files in the format of snmpinfo.dat and merge  the
          contents  to  create  a  <base>info.dat file.  Only the
          specified input files are read.

     -intel
          Move strings in <base>-mib.h out  of  DGROUP  on  Intel
          808x processors.

     -light <filename>
          Generate  output  consistent  with  the  usage  of  the
          -DLIGHT flag.

     -mergeinfo
          Read files in the format of snmpinfo.dat and merge  the
          contents  to create a <base>info.dat file.  In addition
          to  the   specified   input   files,   also   read   in
          snmpinfo.dat.

     -nm4w
          Generate several configuration  files  for  NETMON  for
          Windows.  This option is available only with the NETMON
          for Windows product.

     -o base
          Change the base name of the output files.  The  default
          is  `snmp'.   This  option  should not be used together
          with the -c or -f options.

     -short
          Names are limited to 31 characters (useful  for  old  C
          compilers).


ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variable affects the  behavior  of
     mgrtool.

     SR_MGR_CONF_DIR
          This  variable  changes  the  location  where   mgrtool
          expects  to  find  the snmpinfo.dat file.  This file is
          accessed when the -mergeinfo option is in effect.


FILES
     *.def
          MIB definitions files.  These files  are  generated  by
          mosy(l) and are valid input files for mgrtool.

     <base>info.dat
          Contains name-to-OID translation  information  for  the
          MIB.   This  is  a  data  file which can be merged with
          snmpinfo.dat using the -mergeinfo option.  Merging this
          file  with  snmpinfo.dat allows management applications
          to accept the names of new MIB variables on the command
          line.

     <base>-mib.h
          Contains name-to-OID translation  information  for  the
          MIB.   This is a C source code file intended for use in
          SNMP manager station application development.

     snmpinfo.dat
          The file containing name-to-OID translation information
          which is used by SNMP Research management applications.
          On UNIX systems, the file is normally  located  in  the
          directory  /etc/srconf/mgr/.   (On systems delivered by
          Siemens Nixdorf, the location is /etc/snmp/mgr.)   This
          location  can  be  changed  by  setting the environment
          variable SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.

DIAGNOSTICS
     mgrtool: open for read failed:
          This message indicates that one of the input files does
          not  exist  or  that  the file permissions do not allow
          mgrtool to read one of the the input files.

     mgrtool: bad input line:
          This message indicates that the input does not  consist
          entirely of MIB definitions.

     mgrtool: process_data(), Couldn't find parent:
          This message indicates that the input does not  contain
          enough  information to allow mgrtool to compile the MIB
          defintions.  Usually, this is because the MIB  contains
          an  IMPORTS  clause to reference an external MIB defin-
          tion, and  the  .def  file  containing  the  referenced
          object or macro is not supplied.  Try adding v2-tc.def,
          v2-smi.def, or mib-2.def to the list of input files.

     mgrtool: check_names: Duplicate name with different OID's:
          This message indicates that there is a conflict between
          objects definitions in the input.

     MakeOIDFromDot failed:
          This message will occur when using the -f option if the
          configuration  file  contains the English name of a MIB
          variable which does not appear in any of the MIB defin-
          itions  (*.def)  files.   Try  using  additional  input
          files, or change the name of the offending MIB variable
          from  English to the equivalent numeric OID representa-
          tion.

     truncating ... to ...
          This message indicates that a macro, variable, or func-
          tion  name  in  the  output  is  being  reduced  to  31

          characters because the -short option is in effect.


LIMITATIONS
     Some features require the input .def files to be created  by
     a  version  of  mosy(l),  which  has  been  enhanced by SNMP
     Research.
