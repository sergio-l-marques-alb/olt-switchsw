PREMOSY(l)        MISC. REFERENCE MANUAL PAGES         PREMOSY(l)



NAME
     premosy - preprocessor to  convert  MIB  documents  to  MOSY
     input format

SYNOPSIS
     premosy [ inputfile [ outputfile ] ]


DESCRIPTION
     The premosy program converts files containing MIB  documents
     (including  RFCs and Internet Drafts available online on the
     Internet) to a format used by the mosy(l) program.  It  does
     this  by removing page markers and text outside of the ASN.1
     specifications which are the core of the MIB document.

FILES
     If no inputfile is given or if the inputfile is `-'  premosy
     reads from standard input.

     The outputfile should contain the name of the MIB,  and  the
     extension  should be `.my'.  If no outputfile is given or if
     the outputfile is `-' premosy writes to standard output.


SEE ALSO
     mosy(l), postmosy(l), RFCs 1155, 1157, 1212, and 1902-1908.


BUGS
     If the inputfile contains more than one MIB  document,  only
     the  first  MIB will be converted and written to the output-
     file.
