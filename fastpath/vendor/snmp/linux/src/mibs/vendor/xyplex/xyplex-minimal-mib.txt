            This memo defines a private portion of the Management 
            Information Base (MIB), within the Xyplex branch, for use 
            with SNMP over various transport services, such as UDP or 
            Ethernet.  In particular, it defines objects for minimal

            3.  Historical Perspective
            
            As reported in RFC 1052, IAB Recommendations for the 
            Development of Internet Network Management Standards [1], a 
            two-prong strategy for network management of TCP/IP-based 
            internets was undertaken.  In the short-term, the Simple 
            Network Management Protocol (SNMP), defined in RFC 1067, was 
            to be used to manage nodes in the Internet community.  In 
            the long-term, the use of the OSI network management 
            framework was to be examined.  Two documents were produced 
            to define the management information: RFC 1065, which 
            defined the Structure of Management Information (SMI), and 
            RFC 1066, which defined the Management Information Base 
            (MIB).  Both of these documents were designed so as to be 
            compatible with both the SNMP and the OSI network management 
            framework.
            
            This strategy was quite successful in the short-term: 
            Internet-based network management technology was fielded, by 
            both the research and commercial communities, within a few 
            months.  As a result of this, portions of the Internet 
            community became network manageable in a timely fashion.
            
            As reported in RFC 1109, Report of the Second Ad Hoc Network 
            Management Review Group [2], the requirements of the SNMP 
            and the OSI network management frameworks were more 
            different than anticipated.  As such, the requirement for 
            compatibility between the SMI/MIB and both frameworks was 
            suspended.  This action permitted the operational network 
            management framework, based on the SNMP, to respond to new 
            operational needs in the Internet community by producing 
            MIB-II.
            
            In May of 1990, the core documents were elevated to 
            "Standard Protocols" with "Recommended" status.  As such, 
            the Internet- standard network management framework consists 
            of: Structure and Identification of Management Information 
            for TCP/IP-based internets, RFC 1155 [4], which describes 
            how managed objects contained in the MIB are defined; 
            Management Information Base for Network Management of 
            TCP/IP-based internets, which describes the managed objects 
            contained in the MIB, RFC 1156 [5]; and, the Simple Network 
            Management Protocol, RFC 1157 [6], which defines the 
            protocol used to manage these objects.
            
            Consistent with the IAB directive to produce simple,

            workable systems in the short-term, the list of managed 
            objects defined in the Internet-standard MIB was derived by 
            taking only those elements which are considered essential.  
            However, the SMI defined three extensibility mechanisms: 
            one, the addition of new standard objects through the 
            definitions of new versions of the MIB; two, the addition of 
            widely-available but non- standard objects through the 
            experimental subtree; and three, the addition of private 
            objects through the enterprises subtree.  Such additional 
            objects can not only be used for vendor-specific elements, 
            but also for experimentation as required to further the 
            knowledge of which other objects are essential.
            
            This memo defines extensions to the MIB using the third 
            method.  It contains definitions of managed objects in 
            various Xyplex products as specified in [10].

            4.  Objects
            
            Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information 
            store, termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  
            Objects in the MIB are defined using the subset of Abstract 
            Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) [7] defined in the SMI.  In 
            particular, each object has a name, a syntax, and an 
            encoding.  The name is an object identifier, an 
            administratively assigned name, which specifies an object 
            type.  The object type together with an object instance 
            serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the 
            object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual 
            string, termed the OBJECT DESCRIPTOR, to also refer to the 
            object type.
            
            The syntax of an object type defines the abstract data 
            structure corresponding to that object type.  The ASN.1 
            language is used for this purpose.  However, the SMI [4] 
            purposely restricts the ASN.1 constructs which may be used. 
            These restrictions are explicitly made for simplicity.
            
            The encoding of an object type is simply how that object 
            type is represented using the object type's syntax.  
            Implicitly tied to the notion of an object type's syntax and 
            encoding is how the object type is represented when being 
            transmitted on the network.
            
            The SMI specifies the use of the basic encoding rules of 
            ASN.1 [8], subject to the additional requirements imposed by 
            the SNMP.
            
            
            4.1.  Format of Definitions
            
            Section 6 contains the specification of all object types 
            contained in this MIB module.  The object types are defined 
            using the conventions defined in the SMI, as amended by the 
            extensions specified in [9].

            5.  Overview
            
            The Xyplex Minimal MIB applies to Xyplex systems with 
            terminal ports, such as a terminal server.  It contains 
            relatively few objects, selected as those most important for 
            management of a terminal port.  Future Xyplex products are 
            expected to have considerably expanded MIBs.
            
            The MIB comprises three groups of information:  the System 
            group, the Character group, and the Internet group.  As a 
            convenience for the reader, the following descriptions 
            contain lists of the objects in each group.
            
            The System group contains information common to all Xyplex 
            systems.  It contains one base object, namely:
            
                sysIdent
            
            The Character group contains information for the management 
            of character stream (that is, terminal or printer) ports.  
            It comprises one base object and three tables.  The Physical 
            Character Port table contains information for each physical 
            port.  The Physical Character Input Signal table contains 
            information on hardware connector input signals.  The 
            Physical Character Output Signal table contains information 
            on hardware connector output signals.
            
            The Character group base object is:
            
                charPhysNumber
            
            The objects composing a Physical Character Port entry are:
            
                charPhysIndex
                charPhysPortName
                charPhysAdminAccess
                charPhysOperAccess
                charPhysBits
                charPhysParity
                charPhysSpeed
                charPhysModemControl
                charPhysSignalType
                charPhysInSignalNumber

            The objects composing a Physical Character Input Signal 
            entry are:
            
                charInPhysIndex
                charInSignalName
                charInSignalState
            
            The objects composing a Physical Character Output Signal 
            entry are:
            
                charOutPhysIndex
                charOutSignalName
                charOutSignalState
            
            The Internet group contains information for the system's 
            Internet connection, where such information is not available 
            from the standard SNMP MIB.  It comprises several base 
            objects, namely:
            
                intDomainSuffix
                intDomainAddress1
                intDomainAddress2
                intGatewayAddress1
                intGatewayAddress2
