<h2><a name=portgarpcfg></a>Help for GARP Port Configuration</h2>

<P><B>Note:</b> It can take up to 10 seconds for GARP configuration changes to take effect.
<BR>


<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Interface</b> 
  - Select the physical interface for which data is to be displayed or configured. 
  It is possible to set the parameters for all ports by selecting 'All'.
  </li>
  
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Port GVRP Mode</b> -
      Choose the GARP VLAN Registration Protocol administrative mode for the port
       by selecting enable or disable from the pull-down menu.
       If you select disable, the protocol will not be active and the Join Time, Leave Time and Leave All
      Time will have no effect. The factory default is disable. </li>
  <li><b>Port GMRP Mode</b> -
      Choose the GARP Multicast Registration Protocol
       administrative mode for the port by selecting enable or disable from the pull-down menu.
        If you select disable, the protocol will not be active, and Join Time, Leave Time and Leave All
        Time have no effect. The factory default is disable. </li>
<h4>GARP Timers</h4>
  <li><b>Join Timer (centisecs)</b>
      - Specify the time between the transmission of GARP PDUs
      registering (or re-registering) membership for a VLAN or multicast group
      in centiseconds.
      Enter a number between 10 and 100 (0.1 to 1.0 seconds).
      The factory default is 20 centiseconds (0.2 seconds). 
      An instance of this timer exists for each GARP participant for each port.
      </li>
  <li><b>Leave Timer (centisecs)</b>
      - Specify the time to wait after receiving an unregister
      request for a VLAN or multicast group before deleting the associated entry, in centiseconds.
      This allows time for another station to assert
      registration for the same attribute in order to maintain uninterrupted
      service.  Enter a number between 20 and 600 (0.2 to 6.0
      seconds). The factory default is 60 centiseconds (0.6 seconds).  
      An instance of this timer exists for each GARP participant for each port.
       </li>
  <li><b>Leave All Timer (centisecs)</b>
      - The Leave All Time controls how frequently LeaveAll PDUs are
      generated. A LeaveAll PDU indicates that all registrations will shortly
      be deregistered. Participants will need to rejoin in order to maintain
      registration.  The Leave All Period Timer is set to a random value in
      the range of LeaveAllTime to 1.5*LeaveAllTime. 
      The timer is specified in centiseconds. Enter a number between 200
      and 6000 (2 to 60 seconds). The factory default is 1000
      centiseconds (10 seconds). 
      An instance of this timer exists for each GARP participant for each port. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
