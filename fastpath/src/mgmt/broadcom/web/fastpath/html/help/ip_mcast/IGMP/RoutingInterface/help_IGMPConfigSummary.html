<h2><a name=igmpintfcfgparams></a>Help for IGMP Routing Interface Summary</h2>


  <h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

  <ul type=disc>
   <ul type=circle>
    <li><b>Interface</b> -
        Select the slot and port for which data is to be displayed. Slot 0 is the base unit. </li>
   </ul>
  </ul>

  <h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

  <ul type=disc>
   <ul type=circle>
 <h4>Interface Parameters</h4>
    <li><b>Interface Mode</b> - The administrative status of IGMP on the selected interface. </li>
    <li><b>Operational Mode</b> - The operational state of IGMP on the selected 
        interface.</li>
    <li><b>Version </b> - The version of IGMP configured on the selected interface.</li>
     <li><b>Query Interval (sec)</b> - The frequency at which IGMP host-query packets are
               transmitted on the selected interface.</li>
     <li><b>Query Max Response Time(1/10 th of a sec)</b> - The maximum query response time advertised in IGMPv2
               queries sent from the selected interface.</li>
       <li><b>Robustness </b> - The robustness parameter for the selected interface.
       This variable allows tuning for the expected
                 packet loss on a subnet.  If a subnet is expected to be lossy, the
                 robustness variable may be increased.  IGMP is
                 robust to (robustness variable-1) packet losses. </li>
     <li><b>Startup Query Interval (sec)</b> - The interval at which startup queries are sent on the selected
     interface.</li>
     <li><b>Startup Query Count </b> - The number of queries to be sent on startup.</li>
     <li><b>Last Member Query Interval (1/10 of a sec)</b> - The last member query interval. The last member query
      interval is the maximum response time
                inserted into group-specific queries sent in response to
                leave group messages, and is also the amount of time between
                group-specific query messages.  This value may be tuned to
                modify the leave latency of the network.  A reduced value
                results in reduced time to detect the loss of the last
                member of a group.  This value is not used for IGMP version 1.</li>
      <li><b>Last Member Query Count </b> - The number of queries to be sent on receiving a leave
      group report. </li>
<h4>Interface Statistics</h4>
  <li><b>Querier </b> - The address of the IGMP querier on the IP subnet to which the selected
   interface is attached.</li>
  <li><b>Querier Status </b> - Indicates whether the selected interface is in querier or non querier mode.  </li>
    <li><b>Querier Up Time (hh:mm:ss)</b> - The time in seconds since the IGMP interface querier was last changed. </li>
  <li><b>Querier Expiry Time (hh:mm:ss)</b> - The time in seconds remaining before the other querier
            present timer expires.  If the local system is the querier, this
            will be zero.</li>
  <li><b>Wrong Version Queries Received</b> - The number of queries that have been received
          on the selected interface with an IGMP version that does not
          match the IGMP version configured for the interface, over the lifetime of the entry.
            IGMP requires that all routers on a LAN be configured to run the same version of IGMP.
            Therefore, a configuration error is indicated if any queries are received with the wrong
            version number. </li>
  <li><b>Number of Joins Received</b> - The number of times a group membership has been added on
            the selected interface; that is, the number of times an entry for this interface has been
            added to the cache table.  This gives an indication of the amount of IGMP activity on
            the interface. </li>
  <li><b>Number of Groups </b> - The current number of entries for the selected interface in the
  cache table. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
