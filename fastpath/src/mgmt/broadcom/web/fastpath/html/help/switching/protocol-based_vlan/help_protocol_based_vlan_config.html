<h2><a name=pbvlan_cfg></a>Help for Protocol-based VLAN Configuration</h2>
<P>
You can use a protocol-based VLAN to define filtering criteria for untagged packets.  By default, if
you do not configure any port- (IEEE 802.1Q) or protocol-based VLANs, untagged packets will be assigned to
VLAN 1. You can override this behavior by defining either port-based VLANs or protocol-based VLANs,
or both.  Tagged packets are always handled according to the IEEE 802.1Q standard, and are not
included in protocol-based VLANs.</P>
<p>
If you assign a port to a protocol-based VLAN for a specific protocol, untagged frames received on
that port for that protocol will be assigned the protocol-based VLAN ID. Untagged frames received on
the port for other protocols will be assigned the Port VLAN ID - either the default PVID (1) or a
PVID you have specifically assigned to the port using the Port VLAN Configuration screen.</P>
<p>
You define a protocol-based VLAN by creating a group. Each group has a one-to-one relationship with
a VLAN ID, can include one to sixteen protocol definitions, can include multiple ports and can assign
a group name.</P>

<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Group ID</b> - You can use this screen to reconfigure or delete an existing protocol-based VLAN,
  or create a new one.
  Use this pull-down menu to select one of the existing PBVLANs, or select 'Create New Group' to add a new one.
         You can create up to 128 groups.
         </li>
  <li><b>Interface(s)</b> - Select the interface(s)
         you want to be included in the group.
         Note that a given interface can only belong to one group for a given protocol.
         Ex: If you have already added interface 0.1 to a group for 0x0800, you cannot add it to another
         group that also includes 0x0800, although you could add it to a new group for other ethertype value.

  </li>

 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Group Name</b> - Use this field to assign a name to a existing group. You may enter up to
        1 to 16 alphanumeric characters including underscores, hyphens and spaces. Configuring name for a Group is optional. </li>
  <li><b>VLAN</b> -
         VLAN can be any number in the range of
         <EMWEB_STRING C='
         return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(1, L7_DOT1Q_MAX_VLAN_ID);
          ' > .
         All the ports in the group will assign this VLAN ID to untagged packets received for the
         protocols you included in this group.
  </li>
  <li><b>Protocol-list</b> -
         Protocol-list can be any valid comma(,) separated string with standard "arp", "ip", "ipx" keywords, hexadecimal or decimal values in the range of 0x0600(1536) to 0xFFFF(65535) </li>
 </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Group ID</b> - A number used to identify the group created by the user. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Command Buttons</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Submit</b> - Update the switch with the values on this screen.
  If you want the switch to retain the new values across a power cycle, you must perform a save.
</li>
  <li><b>Delete</b> - Remove the Protocol Based VLAN group identified by
         the value in the Group ID field.
         If you want the switch to retain the deletion across a power cycle, you must perform a save.</li>
 </ul>
