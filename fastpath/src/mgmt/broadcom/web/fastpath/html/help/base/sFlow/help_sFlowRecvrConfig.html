<EMWEB_IF ID=USMWEB_IF_READWRITE >
<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Receiver Index</b> - Selects the receiver for which data is to be displayed or
      configured. Allowed range is
      (1 to 8).
  </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Receiver Owner String</b> - The entity making use of this sFlow Receiver Table entry. The empty
         string indicates that the entry is currently unclaimed and the receiver configuration is
         reset to default values.
         An entity wishing to claim an sFlow Receiver Table entry must ensure
         that the entry is unclaimed before trying to claim it.
         The entry is claimed by setting the owner string. The entry
         must be claimed before any changes can be made to other sampler
         objects. Maximum of 127 characters are allowed.
  </li>
  <li><b>Receiver Timeout</b> - The time (in seconds) remaining before the sampler is released
         and stops sampling.
         A management entity wanting to maintain control of the sampler
         is responsible for setting a new value before the old one expires. Allowed range is
         (0 to 4294967295 secs). A value of zero sets the selected receiver configuration
         to its default values.
  </li>
  <li><b>Receiver Maximum Datagram Size</b> - The maximum number of data bytes that can be sent in a single
         sample datagram. The manager should set this value to avoid fragmentation of the sFlow datagrams.
         Default Value: 1400. Allowed range is
         (200 to 9116).
  </li>
<EMWEB_PROTO>
  <li><b>Receiver Address Type</b> - The type of sFlowRcvrCollectorAddress (IPv4/IPv6).</li>
</EMWEB_PROTO>
  <li><b>Receiver Address</b> - The IP address of the sFlow collector.
    Setting it to 0.0.0.0 will have no effect on the switch i.e. no datagrams will be sent.       
  </li>
  <li><b>Receiver Port</b> - The destination port for sFlow datagrams. Allowed range is 
          (1 to 65535). The default value for port is 6343.
 </li>
</ul>
</EMWEB_IF>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>
<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Receiver Index</b> - The receiver for which data is be displayed or
      configured.
  </li>

  <li><b>Receiver Owner</b> - The entity making use of this sFlow Receiver Table entry. The empty
         string indicates that the entry is currently unclaimed.
  </li>
  <li><b>Receiver Timeout</b> - The time (in seconds) remaining before the sampler is released
         and stops sampling.
  </li>
  <li><b>Receiver Maximum Datagram Size</b> - The maximum number of data bytes that can be sent in a single
         sample datagram. 
  </li>
<EMWEB_PROTO>
  <li><b>Receiver Address Type</b> - The type of sFlowRcvrCollectorAddress.(IPv4/IPv6)</li>
</EMWEB_PROTO>
  <li><b>Receiver Address</b> - The IP address of the sFlow collector.
  </li>
  <li><b>Receiver Port</b> - The destination port for sFlow datagrams.
 </li>
  <li><b>Receiver Datagram Version</b> - The version of sFlow datagrams that should be sent.
 </ul>
</ul>
