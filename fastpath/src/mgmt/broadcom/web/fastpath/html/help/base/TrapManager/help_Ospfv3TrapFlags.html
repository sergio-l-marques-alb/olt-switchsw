<h2><a name=trapflag></a>Help for Trap Manager OSPFv3 Trap Flags</h2>

<p><br>
Use the OSPFv3 Trap Flags page to specify which OSPFv3 traps you want to enable. 
When the condition identified by an active trap is encountered by the switch a trap message will be
sent to any enabled SNMP Trap Receivers, and a message will be written to the trap log. </p>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
<h4>Error Traps</h4>

  <li><b>Bad Packet</b>
      - This trap signifies that an OSPF packet has been received on a non-virtual interface that cannot be parsed. The factory default is disabled.</li> 

  <li><b>Configuration Error</b>
      - This trap signifies that a packet has been received on a non-virtual interface from a router whose configuration parameters conflict with this router's configuration parameters. The factory default is disabled.</li>

  <li><b>Virtual Bad packet</b>
      - This trap signifies that an OSPF packet has been received on a virtual interface that cannot be parsed. The factory default is disabled.</li>

  <li><b>Virtual Link Configuration Error</b>
      - This trap signifies that a packet has been received on a virtual interface from a router whose configuration parameters conflict with this router's configuration parameters. The factory default is disabled.</li>
<h4>LSA Traps</h4>

  <li><b>LSA Max Age</b>
      - This trap signifies that one of the LSA in the router's link-state database has aged to MaxAge. The factory default is disabled.</li>

  <li><b>LSA Originate</b>
      - This trap signifies that a new LSA has been originated by this router. This trap should not be invoked for simple refreshes of LSAs(which happens every 30 minutes), but instead will only be invoked when an LSA is (re)originated due to a topology change. Additionally, this trap does not include LSAs that are being flushed because they have reached MaxAge. The factory default is disabled.</li>
<h4>LSDB Overflow Traps</h4>

  <li><b>LSDB Overflow</b>
      - This trap signifies that the number of LSAs in the router's link-state database has exceeded OSPF External LSDB Limit. The factory default is disabled.</li>

  <li><b>LSDB Approaching Overflow</b>
      - This trap signifies that the number of LSAs in the router's link-state database has exceeded ninety percent of OSPF External LSDB Limit. The factory default is disabled.</li>

<h4>Retransmit Traps</h4>

  <li><b>Retransmit Packets</b>
      - This trap signifies that an OSPF packet has been retransmitted on a non-virtual interface. All packets that may be retransmitted are associated with an LSDB entry. The LS type, LS ID, and Router ID are used to identify the LSDB entry. The factory default is disabled.</li>

  <li><b>Virtual Link Retransmit Packets</b>
      - This trap signifies that an OSPF packet has been retransmitted on a virtual interface. All packets that may be retransmitted are associated with an LSDB entry. The LS type, LS ID, and Router ID are used to identify the LSDB entry. The factory default is disabled.</li> 
<h4>State Change Traps</h4>

  <li><b>Interface State Change</b>
      - This trap signifies that there has been a change in the state of a non-virtual OSPF interface. This trap should be generated when the interface state regresses (e.g., goes from Dr to Down) or progresses to a terminal state (i.e., Point-to-Point, DR Other, Dr, or Backup). The factory default is disabled.</li>

  <li><b>Neighbor State Change</b>
      - This trap signifies that there has been a change in the state of a non-virtual OSPF neighbor. This trap should be generated when the neighbor state regresses (e.g., goes from Attempt or Full to 1-Way or Down) or progresses to a terminal state (e.g., 2-Way or Full). When a neighbor transitions from or to Full on non-broadcast multi-access and broadcast networks, the trap should be generated by the designated router. A designated router transitioning to Down will be noted by OSPF Interface State Change. The factory default is disabled.</li>

  <li><b>Virtual Link Interface State Change</b>
      - This trap signifies that there has been a change in the state of an OSPF virtual interface. This trap should be generated when the interface state regresses (e.g., goes from Point-to-Point to Down) or progresses to a terminal state (i.e., Point-to-Point). The factory default is disabled.</li>

  <li><b>Virtual Neighbor State Change</b>
      - This trap signifies that there has been a change in the state of an OSPF virtual neighbor. This trap should be generated when the neighbor state regresses (e.g., goes from Attempt or Full to 1-Way or Down) or progresses to a terminal state (e.g., Full). The factory default is disabled.</li>
