 <li><b>Access Mode</b>

    The pre-configured users, admin and guest, are assigned to a pre-configured list named defaultList, which you may not delete.
    All newly created users are also assigned to the defaultList until you specifically assign them to a different list </li>
	
  <li><b>Authentication List</b> <!--Authentication List-->
  - Select the authentication list you want to configure. Use dropdown menu to select defaultList,networkList,enableList,Create. Select 'create' to define a new list.

						If you select a method that does not time out as the third method, the fourth method will not be tried.</li>
  <li><b>Method 4</b> - Use the dropdown menu to select the method, if any, that should appear fourth in the selected authentication list.

  <li><b>Method 5</b> - Use the dropdown menu to select the method, if any, that should appear fifth in the selected authentication list.
