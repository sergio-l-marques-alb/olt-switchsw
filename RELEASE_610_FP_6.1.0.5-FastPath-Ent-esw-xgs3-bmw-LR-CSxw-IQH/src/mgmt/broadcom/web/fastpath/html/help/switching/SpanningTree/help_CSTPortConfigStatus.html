<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Port Priority</b> -  The priority for a particular port within the CST.
        The port priority is set in multiples of 16. For example if
         the priority is attempted to be set to any value between 0 and 15, 
         it will be set to 0. If it is tried to be set to any value between 16 and 
         (2*16-1) it will be set to 16 and so on.The valid range is from

             return &staticUINT32;
          ' >.
		  </li>
  <li><b>Admin Edge Port</b> - Specifies if the specified port is an Edge Port 
       within the CIST. It takes a value of enable or disable, where the default value 
        is disable.</li>
  <li><b>Port Path Cost</b> - Set the Path Cost to a new value for the specified 
       port in the common and internal spanning tree. It takes a value in the range of 
	   <EMWEB_STRING C='
             return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(L7_DOT1S_MIN_PORT_PATHCOST ,L7_DOT1S_MAX_PORT_PATHCOST);
	     ' >.
	     Enter '0' to set the path cost value automatically on the basis of Link Speed. Default value is
	     <EMWEB_STRING EMWEB_TYPE=DECIMAL_INT C='
             staticUINT32 = FD_DOT1S_PORT_PATH_COST;
             return &staticUINT32;
	     ' >.
               </li>
  <li><b>External Port Path Cost</b> - Set the External Path Cost to a new value for the specified 
       port in the spanning tree. It takes a value in the range of 
	   <EMWEB_STRING C='
             return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(L7_DOT1S_MIN_PORT_PATHCOST ,L7_DOT1S_MAX_PORT_PATHCOST);

             return &staticUINT32;
         ' >.
	   </li>
  <li><b>BPDU Filter</b>- Configure the BPDU Filter, it filters the BPDU traffic on this port when STP is enabled on this port.
    The possible values are Enable or Disable. It is disabled by default. </li>
  <li><b>BPDU Flood</b>- Configure the BPDU Flood, it floods the BPDU traffic arriving on this port when STP is disabled on this port.
    The possible values are Enable or Disable. It is disabled by default. </li>
  <li><b>Port Mode</b> - Spanning Tree Protocol Administrative Mode associated with the port or
      port channel. The possible values are Enable or Disable. It is disabled by default. </li>
  <li><b>Auto Edge </b> - Configuring the auto edge of a port allows the port to become an edge port if 
      it does not see BPDUs for some duration. The possible values are Enable or Disable. It is disabled by default. </li>
  <li><b>Root Guard</b> - Configuring the root guard mode sets a port to discard any superior 
      information received by the port and thus protect against root of the device from changing.
      The port gets put into discarding state and does not forward any packets.The possible values 
      are Enable or Disable. It is disabled by default. </li>
  <li><b>Loop Guard</b> - Configuring the loop guard mode prevents a port from erroneously transitioning
      from blocking state to forwarding when the port stops receiving BPDUs.
      The port is marked as being in loop-inconsistent state. In this state, the port does not forward
			packets. The possible values are Enable or Disable. It is disabled by default. </li>
  <li><b>TCN Guard</b> - Configuring the TCN guard for a port restricts the port from propagating
       any topology change information received through that port.The possible values 
       are Enable or Disable. It is disabled by default. </li>

  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Auto-calculate Port Path Cost</b> - Displays whether the path cost is automatically
         calculated (Enabled) or not (Disabled).  Path cost will be calculated based
         on the link speed of the port if the configured value for Port Path Cost is zero. </li>
  <li><b>Hello Timer</b> - The field is read-only and cannot be configured.
         According to IEEE 802.1Q-REV 2005 updating hello time is disallowed. </li>

         calculated (Enabled) or not (Disabled).  External Path cost will be calculated based
         on the link speed of the port if the configured value for External Port Path Cost is zero. </li>
  <li><b>BPDU Guard Effect</b> - This field is enabled if the selected port is 
      disabled because on BPDU Guard feature.If BPDU guard feature is enabled, 
      the edge ports will be disabled on the reception of STP pdus.  </li>

         displayed in Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.</li>

         Backup Port, Master Port or Disabled Port. </li>
  <li><b>Designated Root</b> - Root Bridge for the CST. It is made 
      up using the bridge priority and the base MAC address of the bridge.</li>
  <li><b>Designated Cost</b> - Path Cost offered to the LAN by the Designated Port. </li>
  <li><b>Designated Bridge</b> - Bridge Identifier of the bridge with the 
         Designated Port. It is made

   the lowest cost to the LAN. It is made up from the port priority and 
   the interface number of the port.</li>
  <li><b>Topology Change Acknowledge</b> - Identifies whether the next BPDU to be transmitted 
       for this port would have the topology change acknowledgement flag set.
       It is either "True" or "False".</li>
  <li><b>Edge port</b> - indicates whether the port is enabled as an edge port.
       It takes the value "Enabled" or "Disabled". </li>
  <li><b>Point-to-point MAC</b> - Derived value of the point-to-point status. </li>
  <li><b>CST Regional Root</b> - Bridge Identifier of the CST Regional Root. It is made

  <li><b>CST Path Cost</b> - Path Cost to the CST Regional Root. </li>
  <li><b>Loop Inconsistent State</b> - This parameter identifies whether the port is in loop inconsistent state. </li>
  <li><b>Transitions Into Loop Inconsistent State</b> - The number of times this interface has transitioned into loop inconsistent state.</li>
  <li><b>Transitions Out Of Loop Inconsistent State</b> - The number of times this interface has transitioned out of loop inconsistent state.</li>
