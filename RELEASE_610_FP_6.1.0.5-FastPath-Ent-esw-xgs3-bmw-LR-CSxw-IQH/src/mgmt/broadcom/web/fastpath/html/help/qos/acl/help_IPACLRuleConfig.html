<h2><a name=aclRuleCfg></a>Help for IP ACL Rule Config</h2>

 <P>Use these screens to configure the rules for the IP Access Control Lists created using
 the IP Access Control List Configuration screen.  What is shown on this screen varies depending on the current
 step in the rule configuration process.  A Standard/Extended IP ACL must first be selected to configure rules for.
 The rule identification, and the 'Action' and 'Match Every' parameters must be specified next.  If 'Match Every' is set
 to false a new screen will then be presented from which the match criteria can be configured.
 </P>

<h3>Selection Criteria </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>IP ACL</b> - Use the pull down menu to select the IP ACL for which to
      create or update a rule.

      ACL as well as an option to add a new Rule.
      New rules cannot be created if the maximum number of rules has been reached.
      For each rule, a packet must match all the specified criteria in order to be true
      against that rule and for the specified rule action (Permit/Deny) to take place.

      Enter an integer from 0 to 63. The IP DSCP is selected by possibly selection one

      The TOS Mask value is a two-digit hexadecimal number from 00 to ff,

      For example, to check for an IP TOS value having bits 7 and 5 set and bit 1
