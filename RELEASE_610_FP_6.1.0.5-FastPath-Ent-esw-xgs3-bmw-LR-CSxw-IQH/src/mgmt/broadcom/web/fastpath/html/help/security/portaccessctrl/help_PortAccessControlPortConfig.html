<h2><a name=dot1xportcfg></a>Help for Port Access Control Port Configuration</h2>
             
<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Port</b> - Selects
      the port to be configured. When the 
      selection is changed, a screen refresh will occur causing all fields to be 
      updated for the newly selected port. All physical interfaces are 
      valid. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Control Mode</b>
  - This selector lists the options for control mode. The control mode is only set
        if the link status of the port is link up. The options are:
  <UL TYPE="SQUARE">
        <LI>Auto: The authenticator PAE sets the controlled port mode to reflect
        the outcome of the authentication exchanges between the supplicant,
        authenticator, and the authentication server.
         <LI>Force Authorized: The authenticator PAE unconditionally sets the
        controlled port to authorized.
        <LI>Force Unauthorized: The authenticator port access entity (PAE) unconditionally sets the
        controlled port to unauthorized
        <LI>MAC Based: The authenticator PAE sets the controlled port mode to
        reflect the outcome of the authentication exchanges between the
        supplicant, authenticator, and the authentication server on a per
        supplicant basis.
  </UL>
  </li>
 <li><b>Re-authentication Enabled</b>
  - This select field allows the user to enable or disable
      re-authentication of the supplicant for the specified port. The
      selectable values are 'true' and 'false'. If the value is 'true'
      re-authentication will occur. Otherwise, re-authentication will not be
      allowed. The default value is false. Changing the selection will
      not change the configuration until the Submit button is pressed.
  </li>
  
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
 
                                                     
  <li><b>Quiet Period (secs)</b>
  - This input field allows the user to configure the quiet period for the 
      selected port. This command sets the value, in seconds, of the timer used 
      by the authenticator state machine on this port to define periods of time 
      in which it will not attempt to acquire a supplicant.       
      The quiet period is the period for which the authenticator does not attempt 
      to acquire a supplicant after a failed authentication exchange with the supplicant.
      The quiet period 
      must be a number in the range of 0 and 65535. A quiet period value of 0 means that the 
      authenticator state machine will never acquire a supplicant. The default value is 60. 
      Changing the value will not change the configuration until the Submit 
      button is pressed.
  </li>
                                                     
  <li><b>Transmit Period (secs)</b>
  - This input field allows the user to configure the transmit period for 
      the selected port. The transmit period is the value, in seconds, of 
      the timer used by the authenticator state machine on the specified port to 
      determine when to send an EAPOL EAP Request/Identity frame to the 
      supplicant. The transmit period must be a number in the range of 1 and 
      65535. The default value is 30. Changing the value will not change 
      the configuration until the Submit button is pressed.
  </li>

    <li><b>Guest VLAN ID</b>
  - This field allows the user to configure Guest VLAN ID on the interface.
     The valid range is 
      <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(L7_DOT1Q_NULL_VLAN_ID, L7_DOT1Q_MAX_VLAN_ID);
      ' >.The default value is 
       <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerToString(FD_DOT1X_PORT_GUEST_VLAN);
      '>. Changing the value will not change the configuration until the Submit button is pressed. Enter 0 to
     clear the Guest VLAN ID on the interface.
   </li>
  
   <li><b>Guest VLAN Period (secs)</b>
  - This input field allows the user to enter the guest VLAN period for
     the selected port. The guest VLAN period is the value, in seconds, of
     the timer used by the Guest VLAN Authentication. The guest VLAN 
     timeout must be a value in the range of 1 and 300. The default value is 
     90. Changing the value will not change the configuration until the 
     Submit button is pressed.
   </li>

   <li><b>Unauthenticated VLAN ID</b> 
  - This input field allows the user to enter the Unauthenticated VLAN ID for
     the selected port. The valid range is 
     <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(L7_DOT1Q_NULL_VLAN_ID, L7_DOT1Q_MAX_VLAN_ID);
      ' >.The default value is 
       <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerToString(FD_DOT1X_PORT_UNAUTHENTICATED_VLAN);
      '>.
     Changing the value will not change the configuration until the Submit 
     button is pressed. Enter 0 to clear the Unauthenticated VLAN ID on the 
     interface.
   </li>

  <li><b>Supplicant Timeout (secs)</b>
  - This input field allows the user to enter the supplicant timeout for 
      the selected port. The supplicant timeout is the value, in seconds, of 
      the timer used by the authenticator state machine on this port to timeout 
      the supplicant. The supplicant timeout must be a value in the range of 
      1 and 65535. The default value is 30. Changing the value will not 
      change the configuration until the Submit button is pressed.
  </li>
                                                     
  <li><b>Server Timeout (secs)</b>
  - This input field allows the user to enter the server timeout for the 
      selected port. The server timeout is the value, in seconds, of the 
      timer used by the authenticator on this port to timeout the authentication 
      server. The server timeout must be a value in the range of 1 and 
      65535. The default value is 30. Changing the value will not change 
      the configuration until the Submit button is pressed.
  </li>
                                                     
  <li><b>Maximum Requests</b>
  - This input field allows the user to enter the maximum requests for the 
      selected port. The maximum requests value is the maximum number of 
      times the authenticator state machine on this port will retransmit an 
      EAPOL EAP Request/Identity before timing out the supplicant. The 
      maximum requests value must be in the range of 1 and 10. The default 
      value is 2. Changing the value will not change the configuration until 
      the Submit button is pressed.
  </li>
                                                     
  <li><b>Re-authentication Period(secs)</b>
  - This input field allows the user to enter the re-authentication period 
      for the selected port. The re-authentication period is the value, in 
      seconds, of the timer used by the authenticator state machine on this port 
      to determine when re-authentication of the supplicant takes place. The 
      re-authentication period must be a value in the range of 1 and 65535. 
      The default value is 3600. Changing the value will not change the 
      configuration until the Submit button is pressed.
  </li>
                                                     

   <li><b>Maximum Users</b>
  - This input field allows the user to enter maximum number of clients that can 
    get Authenticated on the port in the Mac-based dot1x authentication mode. This 
    field is configurable.The maximum users value is in the range of 
    <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(L7_DOT1X_PORT_MIN_MAC_USERS, L7_DOT1X_PORT_MAX_MAC_USERS);
      ' >.The default value is 
       <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerToString(FD_DOT1X_PORT_MAX_USERS);
      '>. Changing the value will not change the configuration 
    until the Submit button is pressed.
  </li>
</ul>                                                     
</ul>
