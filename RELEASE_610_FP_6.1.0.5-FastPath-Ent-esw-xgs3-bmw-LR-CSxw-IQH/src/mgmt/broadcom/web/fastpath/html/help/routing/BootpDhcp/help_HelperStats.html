  <li><b>DHCP Client Messages Received</b> - The number of valid messages received from a DHCP client.  
                                             The count is only incremented if IP helper is enabled globally, the ingress routing interface is up, and the packet passes a number of validity checks, such as having a TTL &gt;1 and having valid source and destination IP addresses. </li>

  <li><b>UDP Client Messages Relayed</b> - The number of UDP packets relayed.  This count includes DHCP messages relayed as well as all other protocols.  The count is incremented for each server to which a packet is sent. </li>
