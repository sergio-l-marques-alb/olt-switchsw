<h2><a name=macaddr></a>Help for RADIUS Accounting Server Configuration </h2>

<p><br>
 Use the RADIUS Accounting Server Configuration page to view and configure various settings for the current RADIUS accounting servers 
 configured on the system.If at least one RADIUS accounting server is configured on the switch, and a host address is selected in 
 the Accounting Server Host Address field, then additional fields are available on the Accounting Server Configuration page. 
 After you add an accounting server, use the Accounting Server Configuration page to configure the server settings. If you select 
  <b>Add </b>from the Accounting Server Host Address field, the page refreshes and several of the configuration options are hidden.
</p>

<h3>Selection Criteria </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
    <li><b>Accounting Server Host Address</b> -
        Use the drop-down menu to select the IP address of the accounting server to view or configure.
    Select Add to configure additional RADIUS servers.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Host Address</b> -
        IP Address of the configured Accounting RADIUS server. This object cannot be changed after creation.</li>
  
   <li><b>Port</b> -
        Identifies the authentication port the server uses to verify the RADIUS accounting server authentication.
		The port is a UDP port, and the valid range is 1-65535. The default port for RADIUS accounting is 1813. </li>
   <li><b>Secret</b> -
        Specifies the shared secret to use with the specified accounting server. This field is only displayed if you are logged
 		into the switch with READWRITE access.</li>
    <ul type=square>		
   <li><b>Apply</b> :
               The Secret will only be applied if this box is checked. If the box is not checked, 
		       anything entered in the Secret field will have no affect and will not be retained.
		       This field is only displayed if the user has READWRITE access.</li>
   </ul>
       <li><b>RADIUS Accounting Server Name</b> -
          Enter the name of the RADIUS accounting server.
          The name can contain up to 32 alphanumeric characters. Spaces, hyphens, and underscores are also permitted.
		  If you do not assign a name, the server is assigned the default name Default-RADIUS-Server. You can use the same name for 
		  multiple RADIUS accounting servers. RADIUS clients can use accounting servers with the same name as backups for each other.  </li>
