<h2><a name=sFlowPoller></a>Help for sFlow Poller Configuration</h2>
sFlow agent collects time-based sampling of network interface statistics and sends them to the
configured sFlow receivers. A data source configured to collect counter samples is called a poller.
<EMWEB_IF ID=USMWEB_IF_READWRITE >
<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b> Poller Datasource</b> - sFlowDataSource for this sFlow sampler.
         This Agent will support Physical ports only.
    </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Receiver Index</b> - The sFlowReceiver associated with this counter poller. Allowed range is
         (1 to 8).
  </li>
  <li><b>Poller Interval</b> - The maximum number of seconds between successive samples of the
         counters associated with this data source. A sampling interval of 0 disables counter sampling.
         Allowed range is (0 to 86400 secs).
 </li>
</ul>
</ul>
</EMWEB_IF>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>
<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
<li><b> Poller Datasource</b> - sFlowDataSource for this sFlow sampler.
         This Agent will support Physical ports only.
    </li>
  <li><b>Receiver Index</b> - The sFlowReceiver for this sFlow Counter Poller. If set to 0, the poller configuration is set to default and the 
           poller is deleted. Only active receivers can be set. If a receiver expires then all pollers associated with the receiver will also 
           expire. Allowed range is (1 to 8).
  </li>
  <li><b>Poller Interval</b> - The maximum number of seconds between successive samples of the
         counters associated with this data source.
</ul>
</ul>
