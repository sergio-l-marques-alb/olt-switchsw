<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Interface</b> - This
      object indicates the interface index of the interface table entry associated with
      the Processor of this switch. </li>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Total Packets Received (Octets) -- L7_CTR_RX_TOTAL_BYTES
-->
  <li><b>Octets Received</b>
      - The total number of octets of data received by the processor (excluding
      framing bits but including FCS octets). </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Packets Received Without Error -- L7_CTR_RX_TOTAL_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Packets Received Without Errors</b> -
      The total number of packets (including broadcast packets and multicast
      packets) received by the processor. </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Unicast Packets Received -- L7_CTR_RX_UCAST_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Unicast Packets Received</b>
      - The number of subnetwork-unicast packets delivered to a higher-layer
      protocol. </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Multicast Packets Received -- L7_CTR_RX_MCAST_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Multicast Packets Received</b>
      - The total number of packets received that were directed to
      a multicast address. Note that this number does not include packets
      directed to the broadcast address. </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Broadcast Packets Received -- L7_CTR_RX_BCAST_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Broadcast Packets Received</b>
      - The total number of packets received that were directed to
      the broadcast address. Note that this does not include multicast packets.
      </li>
 


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Receive Packets Discarded -- L7_CTR_RX_TOTAL_MAC_ERROR_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Receive Packets Discarded</b>
      - The number of inbound packets which were chosen to be
      discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being
      deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. A possible reason for discarding
      a packet could be to free up buffer space. <br><br></li>
 


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Octets Transmitted -- L7_CTR_TX_TOTAL_BYTES
-->
  <li><b>Octets Transmitted</b>
      - The total number of octets transmitted out of the interface, including
      framing characters. </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Packets Transmitted without Errors -- L7_CTR_TX_TOTAL_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Packets Transmitted Without Errors</b>
      - The total number of packets transmitted out of the
      interface. </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Unicast Packets Transmitted -- L7_CTR_TX_UCAST_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Unicast Packets Transmitted</b>
      - The total number of packets that higher-level protocols
      requested be transmitted to a subnetwork-unicast address, including those
      that were discarded or not sent. </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Multicast Packets Transmitted -- L7_CTR_TX_MCAST_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Multicast Packets Transmitted</b>
      - The total number of packets that higher-level protocols
      requested be transmitted to a Multicast address, including those that
      were discarded or not sent. </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Broadcast Packets Transmitted -- L7_CTR_TX_BCAST_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Broadcast Packets Transmitted</b>
      - The total number of packets that higher-level protocols
      requested be transmitted to the Broadcast address, including those that
      were discarded or not sent. </li>
 

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Transmit Packets Discarded -- L7_CTR_TX_TOTAL_ERROR_FRAMES
-->
  <li><b>Transmit Packets Discarded</b>
      - The number of outbound packets which were chosen to be
      discarded even though no errors had been detected to prevent their being
      deliverable to a higher-layer protocol. A possible reason for discarding
      a packet could be to free up buffer space.<br><br> </li>
 

  
  <li><b>Most Address Entries Ever Used</b>
      - The highest number of Forwarding Database Address Table
      entries that have been learned by this switch since the most recent
      reboot. </li>
 

  <li><b>Address Entries in Use</b>
      - The number of Learned and static entries in the Forwarding
      Database Address Table for this switch. </li>
 

  <li><b>Maximum VLAN Entries</b>
      - The maximum number of Virtual LANs (VLANs) allowed on this
      switch. </li>
 

  <li><b>Most VLAN Entries Ever Used</b>
      - The largest number of VLANs that have been active on this
      switch since the last reboot. </li>
 

  <li><b>Static VLAN Entries</b>
      - The number of presently active VLAN entries on this switch that have
      been created statically. </li>
 

  <li><b>Dynamic VLAN Entries</b>
      - The number of presently active VLAN entries on this switch
      that have been created by GVRP registration. </li>
 

  <li><b>VLAN Deletes</b> -
      The number of VLANs on this switch that have been created and then
      deleted since the last reboot. <br><br></li>

<h3>Command Buttons</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  
  <li><b>Clear Counters</b>
      - Clear all the counters, resetting all switch summary and detailed statistics
      to default values. The discarded packets count cannot be cleared. </li>
