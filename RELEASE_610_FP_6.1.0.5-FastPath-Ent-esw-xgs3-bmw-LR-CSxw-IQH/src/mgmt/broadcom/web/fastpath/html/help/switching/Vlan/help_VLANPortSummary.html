  <li><b>Port VLAN ID Configured</b> -
      The VLAN ID that this port will assign to untagged frames or priority
      tagged frames received on this port. </li>
  <li><b>Acceptable Frame
      Types</b> - Specifies the types of frames that may be received on this
      port. The options are 'VLAN only' and 'Admit All'. When set to 'VLAN
      only', untagged frames or priority tagged frames received on this port
      are discarded. When set to 'Admit All', untagged frames or priority
      tagged frames received on this port are accepted and assigned the value
      of the Port VLAN ID for this port. With either option, VLAN tagged frames
      are forwarded in accordance to the 802.1Q VLAN specification. </li>
  <li><b>Ingress Filtering Configured</b>
      - When enabled, the frame is discarded if this port
      is not a member of the VLAN with which this frame is associated. In a
      tagged frame, the VLAN is identified by the VLAN ID in the tag. In an
      untagged frame, the VLAN is the Port VLAN ID specified for the port that
      received this frame. When disabled, all frames are forwarded in
      accordance with the 802.1Q VLAN bridge specification. The factory default
      is disabled. </li>
