<h2><a name=rt_entry_create></a>Help for Router Route Entry Create</h2>
<h3>Selection Criteria </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Route Type</b> - This field can be either default, static or static reject. If creating a default
      route, all that needs to be specified is the next hop IP address,
      otherwise each field needs to be specified.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Network Address</b> - Specifies the IP route prefix for the destination.This
      field will be present only when creating a static route.
      In order to create a route a valid routing interface must exist and the next hop
      IP Address must be on the same network as the routing
      interface.  Routing interfaces are created on the IP Interface Configuration page.
      Valid next hop IP Addresses can be viewed on the 'Route Table' screen.</li>
  <li><b>Subnet Mask</b> - Also referred to as  the subnet/network mask, this indicates
      the portion of the IP interface address that identifies the attached network.  This
      field will be present only when creating a static route.
       </li>
  <li><b>Next Hop IP Address</b> - The outgoing router IP address to use when
      forwarding traffic to the next router (if any) in the path towards the
      destination.  The next router will always be one of the adjacent
      neighbors or the IP address of the local interface for a directly attached
      network.  When creating a route, the next hop IP must be on the same network as
      the routing interface. Valid next hop IP Addresses can be seen on the 'Route Table' page. This field is 
       not present when route type is static reject.</li>
  <li><b>Preference</b> - Specifies a preference value for the configured next hop.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Command Buttons </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li>
 <b>Cancel</b> - Discard changes made to input fields and return to the Route Entry Configuration page.</li>
  <li>
     <b>Submit</b> - Create the route, sending the updated configuration to the switch.  Configuration changes
      take effect immediately. These changes will not be retained across a power cycle
      unless a save is performed. </li>
 </ul>
