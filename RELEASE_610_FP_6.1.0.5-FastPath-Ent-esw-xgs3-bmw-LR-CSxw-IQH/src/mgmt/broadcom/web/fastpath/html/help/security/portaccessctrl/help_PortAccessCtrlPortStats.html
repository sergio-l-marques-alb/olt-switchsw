<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
                                
<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
                    
  <li><b>Port</b> - Selects
      the port to be displayed. When the 
      selection is changed, a screen refresh will occur causing all fields to be 
      updated for the newly selected port. All physical interfaces are 
      valid. The statistics will be displayed for an Authenticator or a Supplicant depending upon whether the port is a Supplicant or an Authenticator.
