<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Network Address</b> - Specifies the IP route prefix for the destination. This
      field will be present only when creating a static route.
      In order to create a route a valid routing interface must exist and the next hop
      IP Address must be on the same network as the routing
      interface.  Routing interfaces are created on the IP Interface Configuration page.
      Valid next hop IP Addresses can be viewed on the 'Route Table' screen.</li>
  <li><b>Subnet Mask</b> - Also referred to as  the subnet/network mask, this indicates
      the portion of the IP interface address that identifies the attached network.  This
      field will be present only when creating a static route.
       </li>
  <li><b>Next Hop IP Address</b> - The outgoing router IP address to use when
      forwarding traffic to the next router (if any) in the path towards the
      destination.  The next router will always be one of the adjacent
      neighbors or the IP address of the local interface for a directly attached
      network.  When creating a route, the next hop IP must be on the same network as
      the routing interface. Valid next hop IP Addresses can be seen on the 'Route Table' page.</li>
   <li><b>Next Hop Unit/Slot/Port</b> - The outgoing interface number to use when
      forwarding traffic to the next router (if any) in the path towards the
      destination.</li>
  <li><b>Preference</b> - Specifies a preference value for the configured next hop.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
