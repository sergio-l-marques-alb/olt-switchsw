<h2>Help for Port Access Control Supplicant Port Configuration.</h2>

<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Port</b> - Selects the port to be configured. When the selection is changed, a screen refresh will occur causing all fields to be updated for the newly selected port. All physical interfaces are valid. 
  </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
 
<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Control Mode </b> - This selector lists the options for control mode. The options are:
        <ul type=square>
          <li><B>force-unauthorized:</B> The Supplicant port access entity (PAE) unconditionally sets the controlled port to unauthorized. 
        </UL>
        <ul type=square>
          <li><B>auto:</B> The Supplicant PAE sets the controlled port mode to reflect the outcome of the authentication exchanges between the supplicant, authenticator, and the authentication server.
        </UL>
        <ul type=square>
          <li><B>force-authorized:</B> The Supplicant PAE unconditionally sets the controlled port to authorized.
        </UL>
   </li>

   <li><b>User Name </b> - Select the users that will have access to the specified port. The possible values are admin and guest.</li>
</ul></ul>
<h3>Configurable Data</h3>
<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
   <li><b>Start Period (secs)</b> - This input field allows the user to configure the start period for the selected port. This command sets the value, in seconds, of the timer used by the Supplicant state machine on this port to define periods of time after which it will send start message again on Authenticator absence. The start period must be a number in the range of 1 and 65535. The default value is 30 seconds. Changing the value will not change the configuration until the Submit button is pressed.
   </li>

   <li><b>Held Period (secs)</b> - This input field allows the user to configure the Held period for the selected port. The held period is the value, in seconds, of the timer used by the supplicant state machine on the specified port to determine when to send the next EAPOL start frame to the Authenticator on previous authentication failure. The Held period must be a number in the range of 1 and 65535. The default value is 60 seconds. Changing the value will not change the configuration until the Submit button is pressed.
   </li>

   <li><b>Authentication Period (secs)</b> - This input field allows the user to configure the Authentication period for the selected port. The Authentication period is the value, in seconds, of the timer used by the supplicant backend state machine on the specified port to determine the timeout value for the EAPOL messages that are sent out to the Authenticator. The Authentication period must be a number in the range of 1 and 65535. The default value is 30 seconds. Changing the value will not change the configuration until the Submit button is pressed.
   </li>

   <li><b>Maximum Requests  </b> - This input field allows the user to configure the Maximum start messages that can be sent on the selected port. The maximum start request value is the maximum number of start messages to be sent continuously to detect the presence/absence of the Authenticator. The maximum start requests value must be in the range of 1 and 10. The default value is 3.
   </li>

</ul></ul>
<h3>Command Buttons </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li> <b>Submit</b> - Sends the updated configuration to the switch.  Configuration changes
      take effect immediately. These changes will not be retained across a power cycle
      unless a save is performed.
      </li>
  <li><b>Refresh</b> - Refreshes the screen with updated configuration. </li>
 </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
