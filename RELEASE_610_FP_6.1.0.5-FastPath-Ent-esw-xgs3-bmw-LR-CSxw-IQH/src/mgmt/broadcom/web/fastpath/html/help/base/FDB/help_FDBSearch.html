<h2><a name=macaddr></a>Help for Forwarding Database Search</h2>

<p><br>
Use this panel to display information about entries in the forwarding database.
These entries are used by the transparent bridging function to determine how to forward a received frame.
</p>


<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Management Unit</b> - Displays management unit for which Forwarding Database Table
        is to be displayed. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>


<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Filter</b> -
         Specify the entries to be displayed.
    <ul type=square>
   <li><b>Learned</b>:
       If you choose "learned" only MAC addresses that have been learned will be displayed. </li>
   <li><b>All</b>:
       If you choose "all" the whole table will be displayed.</li>

  </LI>
  </UL>
 </ul>
</ul>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>MAC Address </b> -
         You may also search for an individual MAC address.
         Enter the two byte hexadecimal VLAN ID followed by the six byte hexadecimal MAC address in
         two-digit groups separated by colons, for example 01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF where
         01:23 is the VLAN ID and 45:67:89:AB:CD:EF is the MAC address.
         Then click on the search button.
         If the address exists, that entry will be displayed as the first entry followed
         by the remaining (greater) MAC addresses.  An exact match is required.
  </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>MAC Address</b> -
      A unicast MAC address for which the switch has forwarding and/or
      filtering information. The format is a two byte hexadecimal VLAN ID number
      followed by a six byte MAC address with each byte separated by colons.
      For example: 01:23:45:67:89:AB:CD:EF, where
      01:23 is the VLAN ID and 45:67:89:AB:CD:EF is the MAC address.</li>

  <EMWEB_IF ID=USMWEB_COMPONENT_PRESENT VALUE=STACKING >
  <li><b>Source Unit/Slot/Port(s)</b>
      - the port where this address was learned -- i.e. the port through which the MAC
      address can be reached. </li>
  <EMWEB_ELSE>
    <li><b>Source Slot/Port(s)</b>
        - the port where this address was learned -- i.e. the port through which the MAC
      address can be reached. </li>
  </EMWEB_IF>

  <li><b>Interface Index</b> - The Interface Index of the MIB interface table entry associated with
      the source port. </li>
  <li><b>Status</b> - The
      status of this entry. The possible values are: </li>
  <ul type=square>
   <li><b>Static</b>:
       the entry was added when a static MAC filter was defined.</li>
   <li><b>Learned</b>:
       the entry was learned by observing the source MAC addresses of incoming
       traffic, and is currently in use. </li>
   <li><b>Management</b>:
       the system MAC address, which is identified with interface 0.1. </li>
       <LI><B>Self</B>:
       the MAC address of one of the switch's physical interfaces.
    </li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Command Buttons</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Search</b> -
      Search for the specified MAC address. </li>
  <li><b>Refresh</b> - Refresh the data on the screen with the present state of the data in the switch. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
