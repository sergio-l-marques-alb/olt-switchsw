 * IGMP Snooping
 *
 * No direct hardware support for this in Strata/XGS.  We could set up a
 * filter, but decided to let the application do it so it would be
 * fully customizable.
 *
 * Robo and XGS3 have IGMP Snooping support.  It is recommended to
 * use the bcm_switch_control() API directly on XGS3.
