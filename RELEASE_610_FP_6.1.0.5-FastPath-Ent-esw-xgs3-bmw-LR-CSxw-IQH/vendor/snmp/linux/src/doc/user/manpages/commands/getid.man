.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The primary purpose of this application is to demonstrate
SNMPv2c/SNMPv3 error codes.  As such,
.B this
.B utility
.B is
.B designed
.B to
.B fail
.B under
.B SNMPv1.
The
.I getid 
utility is an SNMP application to retrieve the variables
sysDescr.0, sysObjectID.0, sysUpTime.0, sysUpTime.2, and iso.2.0
from a SNMP entity.  The variables sysUpTime.2 and iso.2.0 are
included to illustrate the SNMPv2/SNMPv3 error codes

     NO_SUCH_INSTANCE_EXCEPTION and

     NO_SUCH_OBJECT_EXCEPTION 

respectively.
The
.I getid 
utility is not available for EPIC or Security Pack.
.PP
The arguments to
.I getid
are:
.IP \-v1\ |\ \-v2c\ |\ \-v3
The SNMP version to use when sending the reqest.
.IP \-ctxid\ contextID
By default, the utility assumes that the response to a request 
should be provided by the agent residing at 
.I agent_addr. 
To send a request in a proxy context, 
use the 
.I \-ctxid\ contextID 
argument to specify the 
.I snmpEngineID 
of the agent that should provide the response. The 
.I contextID 
(
.I snmpEngineID
) is a printable ASCII string.
.IP \-ctx\ contextName
By default, the utility sends all requests in the "default" context. 
To send a request in a different context, 
The 
.I \-ctx\ contextName 
argument specifies the context of the response. The 
.I contextName
is a printable ASCII string.
.IP \-d
The
.I -d
argument turns on message logging.
When this feature is selected, the utility prints messages
containing important information at milestone points of execution,
and this is useful for problem diagnosis.
.IP \-timeout\ seconds
By default, the utility will wait a total of ten(10) seconds
to receive a response from an SNMP agent.  If no response
is received within that timeout period, the utility may
try again to send the request.  The
.I \-timeout\ seconds
(or
.I \-t\ seconds
)
argument can be used to change the
length of the timeout period where `seconds' is the time
in seconds.
.IP \-retries\ number
By default, if the utility receives no response from the
SNMP agent, it will try again five(5) more times to send the
request.  The
.I \-retries\ number
(or
.I \-r\ number
)
argument can be used to change the number of times the
utility will send the request where `number' is the number
of retries.
.IP agent_addr
The address of the SNMP agent.
.IP community|userName
Either an SNMPv2C community string or an SNMPv3 user name. 

.SH EXAMPLE
This example shows the results of running
.I getid
with an SNMPv2C or SNMPv3 agent.
.PP
The following SNMPv1 request fails on the fourth variable in the VarBind
list, sysUpTime.2.  This is because sysUpTime does not have an
instance `2'.

.in+4
.nf
% getid -v1 localhost public
Error code set in packet - No such variable name.  Index:  4.
.fi
.in-4

.PP
The following SNMPv2C request `succeeds' with robust reporting of errors
on the last two VarBinds.

.in+4
.nf
% getid -v2c localhost public
sysDescr.0 = SNMPv2 agent from SNMP Research, Inc.
sysObjectID.0 = 0.0
sysUpTime.0 = 7982
sysUpTime.2 = NO_SUCH_INSTANCE_EXCEPTION
iso.2.0 = NO_SUCH_OBJECT_EXCEPTION
.fi
.in-4

.PP
The following SNMPv3 request `succeeds' with robust reporting of errors
on the last two VarBinds.

.in+4
.nf
% getid -v3 localhost public
Enter Authentication password : 
sysDescr.0 = SNMPv2 agent from SNMP Research, Inc.
sysObjectID.0 = 0.0
sysUpTime.0 = 8672
sysUpTime.2 = NO_SUCH_INSTANCE_EXCEPTION
iso.2.0 = NO_SUCH_OBJECT_EXCEPTION

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP Failure\ in\ snmpinfo.dat
This message indicates that there is a problem with the named
configuration file.  Check to see that there is an
.I snmpinfo.dat(SR_FMTMAN)
file located in the default directory
or in the directory indicated by the environment variable
SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.  If the file exists, ensure that the file
is readable and contains the correct information.
.IP Error\ code\ set\ in\ packet\ \-\ No\ such\ variable\ name.\ Index:\ 4.
This message
.B should
be printed for SNMPv1 executions of
.I getid.
This message indicates that there is a problem with the fourth
VarBind, sysUpTime.2.  The problem is that there is no
instance 2 for the variable sysUpTime.  Because SNMPv1 does not
have a robust error-reporting facility, the entire request fails.
