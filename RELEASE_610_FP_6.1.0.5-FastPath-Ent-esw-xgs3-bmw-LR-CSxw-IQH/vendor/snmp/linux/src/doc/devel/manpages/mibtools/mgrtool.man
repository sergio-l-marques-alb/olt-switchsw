.SH NAME
mgrtool \- MOSY post processor for managers

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mgrtool
[
.B \-o base
|
.B \-f configfile
] [
.B options ...
] [
.B *.def
]
.PP
.B mgrtool
[

.B *info.dat
]
.PP

[
.B \-mergeinfo
] [
.B *info.dat
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I mgrtool
program reads the concatenated output of
.I mosy(SR_CMDMAN)
and generates several files used for developing SNMP compliant
managers.  Files generated by
.I mosy(SR_CMDMAN)
(which are input files to
.I mgrtool
) end with the extension `.def'.  Zero, one, or many 
.I .def
files may be supplied on the command line.  If no
.I .def
files are given
.I mgrtool
reads from standard input.
.PP
Using all of the default settings,
.I mgrtool
generates
snmpinfo.dat and
snmp-mib.h.
The snmpinfo.dat file is used by SNMP Research Utilities and other
management applications.
.PP
All files generated by
.I mgrtool
have a common base name, which is `snmp' by default but can be changed.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-c\ string
Provide one line of configuration information on the command line.
The contents of
.I string
may be the same as any one line of
.I configfile
(refer to the
.I \-f
option).
This method of configuration can be used to compile only selected
portions of the MIB.  This option should not be used together with the
.I \-f
or
.I \-o
options.
.IP \-f\ configfile
Read configuration information from
.I configfile.
This method of configuration can be used to compile only selected portions
of the MIB, or it can be used to distribute output across multiple
sets of files with different base names.  Because the configuration
file specifies a base name for output files, this option should not
be used together with the
.I \-c
or
.I \-o
options.
.IP \-inputinfo
Read files in the format of snmpinfo.dat and merge the contents
to create a <base>info.dat file.  Only the specified input files
are read.
.IP \-intel
Move strings in <base>\-mib.h out of DGROUP on
Intel 808x processors.
.IP \-light\ <filename>
Generate output consistent with the usage of the -DLIGHT flag.
.IP \-mergeinfo
Read files in the format of snmpinfo.dat and merge the contents
to create a <base>info.dat file.  In addition to the specified
input files, also read in snmpinfo.dat.
.IP \-nm4w
Generate several configuration files for NETMON for Windows.
This option is available only with the NETMON for Windows product.
.IP \-o\ base
Change the base name of the output files.  The default is `snmp'.
This option should not be used together with the
.I \-c
or
.I \-f
options.
.IP \-short
Names are limited to 31 characters (useful for old C compilers).

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable affects the behavior of
.I mgrtool.
.IP SR_MGR_CONF_DIR
This variable changes the location where
.I mgrtool
expects to find the snmpinfo.dat file.  This file is accessed
when the
.I \-mergeinfo
option is in effect.

.SH "FILES"
.IP *.def
MIB definitions files.  These files are generated by
.I mosy(SR_CMDMAN)
and are valid input files for
.I mgrtool.
.IP <base>info.dat
Contains name\-to\-OID translation information for the MIB.
This is a data file which can be merged with snmpinfo.dat using the
.I \-mergeinfo
option.  Merging this file with snmpinfo.dat allows management
applications to accept the names of new MIB variables on the command
line.
.IP <base>-mib.h
Contains name\-to\-OID translation information for the MIB.
This is a C source code file intended for use in SNMP manager
station application development.
.IP snmpinfo.dat
The file containing name\-to\-OID translation information which is used
by SNMP Research management applications.  On UNIX systems, the file is
normally located in the directory /etc/srconf/mgr/.  (On systems
delivered by Siemens Nixdorf, the location is /etc/snmp/mgr.)  This
location can be changed by setting the environment variable
SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
.I premosy(SR_CMDMAN),
.I mosy(SR_CMDMAN),
RFCs 1155, 1157, 1212, and 1902-1908.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP mgrtool:\ open\ for\ read\ failed:
This message indicates that one of the input files does not exist
or that the file permissions do not allow
.I mgrtool
to read one of the the input files.
.IP mgrtool:\ bad\ input\ line:
This message indicates that the input does not consist entirely
of MIB definitions.
.IP mgrtool:\ process_data(),\ Couldn't\ find\ parent:
This message indicates that the input does not contain enough
information to allow
.I mgrtool
to compile the MIB defintions.  Usually, this is because the
MIB contains an IMPORTS clause to reference an external MIB
defintion, and the
.I .def
file containing the referenced object or macro is not supplied.
Try adding v2-tc.def, v2-smi.def, or mib-2.def to the list of
input files.
.IP mgrtool:\ check_names:\ Duplicate\ name\ with\ different\ OID's:
This message indicates that there is a conflict between objects
definitions in the input.
.IP MakeOIDFromDot\ failed:
This message will occur when using the
.I \-f
option if the configuration file contains the English name of a
MIB variable which does not appear in any of the MIB definitions
.I (*.def)
files.  Try using additional input files, or change the name of the
offending MIB variable from English to the equivalent numeric OID
representation.
.IP truncating\ ...\ to\ ...
This message indicates that a macro, variable, or function name
in the output is being reduced to 31 characters because the
.I \-short
option is in effect.

.SH LIMITATIONS
Some features require the input
.I .def
files to be created by a version of
.I mosy(SR_CMDMAN),
which has been enhanced by SNMP Research.
