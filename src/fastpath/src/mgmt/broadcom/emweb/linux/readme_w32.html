To install EmWeb, run "emweb_win32_win32.exe" which will install the 
EmWeb/Compiler executable and the sources needed to build the EmWeb/Server.

During installation you will be prompted to choose a directory to install in. 
By default, this directory is C:\Agranat\EmWeb. From
here on we will refer to it as EMWEB_HOME.<P>

Once it has been installed, the autoexec.bat file will be modified to include
the EMWEB_HOME environment variable. The PATH environment variable will be 
modified to include EMWEB_HOME and EMWEB_HOME\win32_win32\bin.win32. A back up
copy of autoexec.bat is saved automatically during the installation process.<P>

Note: in order for the new environment variables to take effect, you must 
run autoexec.bat - i.e. reboot the machine so that all windows will know 
about these new values.<P>

Should you choose to "reinstall" the product, the install script
will check if the location chosen already has EmWeb code in it.  If there
is, it will ask if you want to choose another directory to install into,
save the current directory as a .bak directory and then install over it,
or simply write over the current directory.<P>


<P ID="emweb_env"><FONT SIZE=+1><strong>EmWeb Environment Variables</strong></FONT><P>

EMWEB_HOME is the environment variable used by the EmWeb/Compiler to determine
the location of the default mime.types file.  
The default mime.types file used for this build is located in EMWEB_HOME\{host_target}\websrc\compiler\mime.types. (Note that {host_target} denotes the host where this software is installed and the target platform. i.e. EMWEB_HOME\win32_win32\websrc\compiler\mime.types, or EMWEB_HOME\win32_vxworks\compiler\mime.types etc.).  If you wish to change the mime.types file, you should copy it from this location, edit it and put it in the EMWEB_HOME directory.<P>

By default, for NT or Win95/98 environments, it is set to 
C:\Agranat\EmWeb.  If you choose to install EmWeb in a 
different location, the EMWEB_HOME environment variable is modified 
appropriately in the autoexec.bat file.  You need to run autoexec.bat for 
this environment variable to take effect.<P>

 <DT>SUPPORT
  <DD>Instructions on how to get technical support from Agranat Systems.

 <DT>emweb.dsw
  <DD>This is the Visual C++ workspace which you will open up to build the server library and the EmWeb Server.

 <DT>websrc\compiler\mime.types 
  <DD>The default mime.types file.  This is used by the EmWeb/Compiler to
   identify the various types of input files compiled (html, java classes,
   GIF images, etc).  The EmWeb/Compiler's -m switch can be used to change
   the location of the mime.types file.  See the EmWeb Users Guide for
   more information.

 <DT>bin.win32\
  <DD>This directory contains the following executables:
    <OL>
     <LI>ewc.exe: the EmWeb compiler, which is used to create archives.
     <LI>readarchive.exe: a tool used to read the archives created.
     <LI>ewsdist.exe: a prebuilt version of the EmWeb/Server to run on Windows.
    </OL>

 <DT>config\
  <DD>This directory contains various configuration files.

 <DT>lib\
  <DD>This directory contains the buffer and compression directories.
  These files should not be modified.   Sample implementations of EmWeb's buffer primitives  can be found in the lib\buffer subdirectory.

 <DT>obj.x86-pc-win-vcc\
  <DD>This directory contains object and library files from the build process.

 <DT>websrc\
  <DD>This contains the sources needed to build the server library.
 <DT>websrc\compiler
  <DD>This directory contains 2 files
  <ol>
  <li>magic - the magic numbers used by various files produced by the EmWeb compiler.  This can be used with the UNIX "file" command.
 <li>mime.types - the default mime.types file that will be used by the
          EmWeb compiler (ewc).  See the EmWeb Functional Specification
          for more information about the mime.types file.
</ol>
<dt>websrc\include\
<dd>  The include directory contains EmWeb server header files.  These
  header files provide interfaces for your application code.  See the
  EmWeb Functional Specification for more information.  These files
  should not be modified.

<dt>websrc\server\
<dd>This directory contains the sources for the EmWeb Server.  Do not
  modify any of these sources.

<dt>content\
<dd>This directory contains the index.html file used as the content for the sample server.  You may change this directory to include your content.

<dt>posix\
<dd>This directory contains a port of the EmWeb Server to various
  POSIX sockets-like operating systems.  Such systems include vxworks,
  PSOS, and Windows.

<dd>This directory contains the ewsdist.dsp (vc++ project file) to build
  a sample EmWeb Server executable (ewsdist.exe).
  By modifying the <EMWEB_HOME>win32_win32\content\ directory, you can change rebuild
  EmWeb Server.


<p>(NOTE: To build on a WIN32 platform under Visual C++,
   you ONLY need to open up the ewsdist.dsp project file which is
   available by opening up the ews_dist.dsw file in Visual C++).
  
<p>Feel free to use these files as a basis for porting EmWeb to your
  embedded target system.

<P id="emweb_req"><FONT SIZE=+1><strong>Requirements to Build/Use the EmWeb Product</strong></FONT><P>
<OL>
 <LI>
  You must have a valid FLEXLM license from Agranat Systems in order to 
  use the EmWeb/Compiler (ewc.exe). (See "EmWeb License Requirements" below).
<LI>
To build the product, you must have Visual C++ installed, and it is 
assumed you are familiar with Visual C++.  The Visual C++ files are based on 
Visual C++ version 5.0.  No other version of Visual C++ is supported
at this time.

</OL><P>

<P id="emweb_lic"><FONT SIZE=+1><strong>EmWeb License Requirements</strong></FONT><P>

Note that to run the EmWeb compiler, ewc.exe, you must first install the 
EmWeb Licensing Software and obtain a license from Agranat Systems, Inc. <P>

Please contact Agranat Systems for more information about our licensing
software (<A HREF="mailto:support@agranat.com">support@agranat.com</A>).<P>

The documentation in the EmWeb Licensing software explains how and where 
to set up the license manager, the Agranat vendor daemon used for licensing, 
and the license file.<P>

<P id="emweb_build"><FONT SIZE=+1><strong>Building a Sample WIN32 EmWeb/Server</strong></FONT><P>
<p>You can use this Win32 port to start development of your target's
Web content prior to porting EmWeb/Server to your target.  See
<A HREF=readme_w32_w32.html>Building EmWeb on Win32</A> for details about how to build and run an EmWeb/Server on win32 platform and target, as well as other platform specific notes.

<P id="emweb_uninstall"><FONT SIZE=+1><strong>Uinstalling EmWeb/Server</strong></FONT><P>
<UL>
 <LI>Select the Control Panel
 <LI>Select Add/Remove Programs icon
 <LI>Select to uninstall(remove) the EmWeb Server for Vxworks Product<BR>
    This will cause the directory and its contents to be removed.
    Note that the autoexec.bat file cannot be modified back to
    its original state, (but it is saved as a backup file).
</UL>

NOTE that in the current release, if you have anything in the target directory
where you installed EmWeb product, which was not originally there, (such
as the object files), you will get a message from Remove/Install program 
indicating that it could not delete certain directories and that
they should be removed by hand.  That is because the current uninstall program
just deletes files which were originally installed, and not files or 
directories which were added after the installation.
