        This file specifies the layout of various levels of pages
        possible values for the style include tree and tabs.
        it is also possible to have additional such layout-styles 
        defined in future.

        Multiple levels can exist. 

        Tool dependencies -

                - xE reads this file and generates the html code accordingly.
                - xI allows users to defins a specific layout for their 'web'.
                - No dependency on xL 

        Other XML file dependencies -

                - this file is specifically used only in the container.
                - container xml file refers to the layout styles mentioned this 
                  file.
                - container xml can specifically mention a style, if the generic 
                definition needs to be overridden. 
                - this is only used in web pages. no other UI pages use these styles.
                
        Thus, the layout mechanism is separated from the xml files containing 
        the core web functionality. the files themselves are unaware of how
        they are being laid-out on the screen.

  <web-layout version="1">
    <level name="level1" style="tree" open-icon="folder-open.png" close-icon="folder-close.png" display-grid="yes" />
    <!-- 
                open-icon and close-icon refer to tree icons displayed. 
                if not mentioned specifically, the defaults will be used, these look like 
                what we have today, looking like windows style.
                display-grid refers to the dotted line that connects the individual nodes.
                default is always yes.
                neither of these properties are applicable for tabs.
                -->
    <level name="level2" style="tabs" tab-background="my-tab.png" />
    <!-- 
                tab-background refers to the image displayed on the tab, behind the name.
                not applicable for tree nodes
                -->
    <level name="level3" style="tabs" />
    <level name="level4" style="tree" />
    <level name="level5" style="tree" />
    <level name="leaf" leaf-background="light-cyan.png" style="tabs" />
    <!--
                This is a special node. It indicates that the node is a leaf node. 
                A specific background can be mentioned for any node. If not mentioned
                it will be no-background.
                -->
  </web-layout>
</FastPathXML>
<!-- 
Some of the options mentioned above can be optional for first release
They are just mentioned here for the sake of completeness.
Also, how much of this style specification conflicts with the usual css ?

The following may be moved to css, if possible
        leaf-background
        tab-background
        open-icon
        close-icon
        display-grid
