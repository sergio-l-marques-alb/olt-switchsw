<h2>Help for IPv6 Access Control Lists Configuration</h2>
<p>
      An IPv6 ACL consists of a set of rules which are matched
      sequentially against a packet. When a packet meets the match
      criteria of a rule, the specified rule action (Permit/Deny)
      is taken and the additional rules are not checked for a match.
      On this menu the interfaces to which an IPv6 ACL applies must
      be specified, as well as whether it applies to inbound or
      outbound traffic. Rules for the IPv6 ACL are specified/created
      using the IPv6 ACL Rule Configuration menu.</P>
