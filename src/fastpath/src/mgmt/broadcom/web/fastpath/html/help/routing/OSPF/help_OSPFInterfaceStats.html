<h2><a name=ospfintfstats></a>Help for OSPF Interface Statistics</h2>

This screen displays statistics for the selected interface.  The
information will be displayed only if OSPF is enabled.

<h3>Selection Criteria </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Interface</b> -
      Select the interface for which data is to be displayed.
     </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>OSPF Area ID</b> - The OSPF area to which the selected router
        interface belongs.  An OSPF Area ID is a 32 bit integer in dotted decimal format that uniquely
        identifies the area to which the interface connects. </li>
  <li><b>Area Border Router Count</b> - The total number of area border routers reachable
       within this area.  This is initially zero, and is calculated in each SPF Pass. </li>
  <li><b>AS Border Router Count</b> - The total number of Autonomous  System  border
       routers  reachable  within  this area.  This is initially zero, and is
       calculated in  each  SPF Pass. </li>
  <li><b>Area LSA Count</b> - The total number of link-state  advertisements
      in  this  area's link-state database, excluding AS External LSAs.</li>
  <li><b>IP Address</b> - The IP address of the interface. </li>
  <li><b>Interface Events</b> - The number of times the specified OSPF interface
      has changed its state, or an error has occurred. </li>
  <li><b>Virtual Events</b> - The number of state changes or errors that have occurred
      on this virtual link. </li>
  <li><b>Neighbor Events</b> - The number of times this neighbor relationship
      has changed state, or an error has occurred. </li>
  <li><b>External LSA Count</b> - The number of external (LS type 5)  link-state
      advertisements in the link-state database. </li>
  <li><b>Sent packets</b> - The number of OSPF packets transmitted on the interface. </li>
  <li><b>Received packets</b> - The number of valid OSPF packets received on the interface. </li>
  <li><b>Discards</b> - The number of received OSPF packets discarded because of an error in the packet 
         or an error in processing the packet. </li>
  <li><b>Bad Version</b> - The number of received OSPF packets whose version field in the OSPF header 
         does not match the version of the OSPF process handling the packet.</li>
  <li><b>Source Not On Local Subnet</b> - The number of received packets discarded because the 
         source IP address is not within a subnet configured on a local interface. </li>
  <li><b>Virtual Link Not Found</b> - The number of received OSPF packets discarded where the ingress interface 
         is in a non-backbone area and the OSPF header identifies the packet as belonging to the backbone, 
         but OSPF does not have a virtual link to the packet's sender. </li>
  <li><b>Area Mismatch</b> - The number of OSPF packets discarded because the area ID in the OSPF header 
         is not the area ID configured on the ingress interface. </li>
  <li><b>Invalid Destination Address</b> - The number of OSPF packets discarded because the packet's destination 
         IP address is not the address of the ingress interface and is not the AllDrRouters or AllSpfRouters 
         multicast addresses. </li>
  <li><b>Wrong Authentication Type</b> - The number of packets discarded because the authentication type 
         specified in the OSPF header does not match the authentication type configured on the ingress 
         interface. </li>
  <li><b>Authentication Failure</b> - The number of OSPF packets dropped because the sender is not an 
         existing neighbor or the sender's IP address does not match the previously recorded IP address 
         for that neighbor. </li>
  <li><b>No Neighbor at Source Address</b> - The number of OSPF packets dropped because the sender is not an 
         existing neighbor or the sender's IP address does not match the previously recorded IP address 
         for that neighbor. </li>
  <li><b>Invalid OSPF Packet Type</b> - The number of OSPF packets discarded because the packet type 
         field in the OSPF header is not a known type.</li>
  <li><b>Hellos Ignored</b> - The number of received Hello packets that were ignored by this router from the 
         new neighbors after the limit has been reached for the number of neighbors on an interface or on the
         system as a whole. </li>
  <li><b>Hellos Sent</b> - The number of Hello packets sent on this interface by this router. </li>
  <li><b>Hellos Received</b> - The number of Hello packets received on this interface by this router. </li>
  <li><b>DD Packets Sent</b> - The number of Database Description packets sent on this interface by this 
         router. </li>
  <li><b>DD Packets Received</b> - The number of Database Description packets received on this interface by 
         this router. </li>
  <li><b>LS Requests Sent</b> - The number of LS Requests sent on this interface by this router. </li>
  <li><b>LS Requests Received</b> - The number of LS Requests received on this interface by this router. </li>
  <li><b>LS Updates Sent</b> - The number of LS updates sent on this interface by this router. </li>
  <li><b>LS Updates Received</b> - The number of LS updates received on this interface by this router. </li>
  <li><b>LS Acknowledgements Sent</b> - The number of LS acknowledgements sent on this interface 
         by this router. </li>
  <li><b>LS Acknowledgements Received</b> - The number of LS acknowledgements received on this interface 
         by this router. </li>
