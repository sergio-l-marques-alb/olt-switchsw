<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>

  <li><b> IpInReceives                  </b> - The total number of input datagrams received from
      interfaces, including those received in error. </li>
  <li><b> IpInHdrErrors            </b> - The number of input datagrams discarded due to
      errors in their IP headers, including bad checksums, version number mismatch, other format
      errors, time-to-live exceeded, errors discovered in processing their IP options, etc. </li>
  <li><b> IpInAddrErrors </b> - The number of input datagrams discarded because
      the IP address in their IP header's destination field was not a valid address to be received at
      this entity.  This count includes invalid addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0) and addresses of
      unsupported Classes (e.g., Class E).  For entities which are not IP Gateways and therefore do not
      forward datagrams, this counter includes datagrams discarded because the destination address was not
      a local address. </li>
  <li><b> IpForwDatagrams                  </b> - The number of input datagrams for which this
      entity was not their final IP destination, as a result of which an attempt was made to find a
      route to forward them to that final destination. In entities which do not act as IP Gateways, this
      counter will include only those packets which were Source-Routed via this entity, and the
      Source-Route option processing was successful. </li>
  <li><b> IpInUnknownProtos  </b> - The number of locally-addressed datagrams
      received successfully but discarded because of an unknown or unsupported protocol. </li>
  <li><b> IpInDiscards       </b> - The number of input IP datagrams for which no
      problems were encountered to prevent their continued processing, but which were discarded
      (e.g., for lack of buffer space).  Note that this counter does not include any datagrams discarded
      while awaiting re-assembly. </li>
  <li><b> IpInDelivers      </b> - The total number of input datagrams successfully
      delivered to IP user-protocols (including ICMP). </li>
  <li><b> IpOutRequests            </b> - The total number of IP datagrams which local IP
      user-protocols (including ICMP) supplied to IP in requests for transmission.  Note that this counter
      does not include any datagrams counted in ipForwDatagrams. </li>
  <li><b> IpOutDiscards      </b> - The number of output IP datagrams for which no
      problem was encountered to prevent their transmission to their destination, but which were
      discarded (e.g., for lack of buffer space).  Note that this counter would include datagrams counted
      in ipForwDatagrams if any such packets met this (discretionary) discard criterion. </li>
  <li><b> IpOutNoRoutes                   </b> - The number of IP datagrams discarded because no
      route could be found to transmit them to their destination.  Note that this counter includes any
      packets counted in ipForwDatagrams which meet this `no-route' criterion.  Note that this includes any
      datagrams which a host cannot route because all of its default gateways are down. </li>
  <li><b>IpReasmTimeout       </b> - The maximum number of seconds which received
      fragments are held while they are awaiting reassembly at this entity. </li>
  <li><b> IpReasmReqds             </b> - The number of IP fragments received which needed
      to be reassembled at this entity. </li>
  <li><b> IpReasmOKs              </b> - The number of IP datagrams successfully re-assembled. </li>
  <li><b> IpReasmFails     </b> - The number of failures detected by the IP re-assembly
  algorithm (for whatever reason: timed out, errors, etc).  Note that this is not
      necessarily a count of discarded IP fragments since some algorithms can lose track of the number of fragments
      by combining them as they are received. </li>
  <li><b> IpFragOKs              </b> - The number of IP datagrams that have been
      successfully fragmented at this entity. </li>
  <li><b> IpFragFails           </b> - The number of IP datagrams that have been
      discarded because they needed to be fragmented at this entity but could not be, e.g., because their
      Don't Fragment flag was set. </li>
  <li><b> IpFragCreates                              </b> - The number of IP datagram fragments that have
      been generated as a result of fragmentation at this entity. </li>
  <li><b> IpRoutingDiscards                    </b> - The number of routing entries which were chosen
      to be discarded even though they are valid.  One possible reason for discarding such an entry could
      be to free-up buffer space for other routing entries. </li>

  <li><b> IcmpInMsgs             </b> - The total number of ICMP messages which the
      entity received.  Note that this counter includes all those counted by icmpInErrors. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInErrors                  </b> - The number of ICMP messages which the entity
      received but determined as having ICMP-specific errors (bad ICMP checksums, bad length, etc.). </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInDestUnreachs      </b> - The number of ICMP Destination Unreachable
      messages received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInTimeExcds                 </b> - The number of ICMP Time Exceeded messages
      received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInParmProbs            </b> - The number of ICMP Parameter Problem messages
      received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInSrcQuenchs                </b> - The number of ICMP Source Quench messages
      received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInRedirects                     </b> - The number of ICMP Redirect messages received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInEchos                                  </b> - The number of ICMP Echo (request) messages
      received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInEchoReps                   </b> - The number of ICMP Echo Reply messages received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInTimestamps                    </b> - The number of ICMP Timestamp (request) messages received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInTimestampReps              </b> - The number of ICMP Timestamp Reply messages received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInAddrMasks         </b> - The number of ICMP Address Mask Request messages received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpInAddrMaskReps           </b> - The number of ICMP Address Mask Reply messages received. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutMsgs                                  </b> - The total number of ICMP messages which this
      entity attempted to send.  Note that this counter includes all those counted by icmpOutErrors. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutErrors              </b> - The number of ICMP messages which this entity did
      not send due to problems discovered within ICMP such as a lack of buffers.  This value should not
      include errors discovered outside the ICMP layer such as the inability of IP to route the resultant
      datagram.  In some implementations there may be no types of error which contribute to this counter's
      value. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutDestUnreachs      </b> - The number of ICMP Destination Unreachable messages sent. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutTimeExcds                    </b> - The number of ICMP Time Exceeded messages sent. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutParmProbs                </b> - The number of ICMP Parameter Problem messages sent. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutSrcQuenchs               </b> - The number of ICMP Source Quench messages sent. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutRedirects                         </b> - The number of ICMP Redirect messages sent.  For a
      host, this object will always be zero, since hosts do not send redirects. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutEchos                             </b> - The number of ICMP Echo (request) messages sent. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutEchoReps                       </b> - The number of ICMP Echo Reply messages sent. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutTimestamps                        </b> - The number of ICMP Timestamp (request) messages. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutTimestampReps                  </b> - The number of ICMP Timestamp Reply messages sent. </li>
  <li><b> IcmpOutAddrMasks                  </b> - The number of ICMP Address Mask Request messages sent. </li>
  <!--    Next Release

      Cleared</b> - The elapsed time, in days, hours, minutes, and seconds since the
      statistics for this router were last cleared. </li>     -->
