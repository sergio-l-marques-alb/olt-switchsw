<H3>Operation</H3>

<P>Packets are filtered and processed based on defined criteria.  The
 filtering criteria is defined by a class.  The processing is defined by
 a policy's attributes.  Policy attributes may be defined on a per-class 
 instance basis, and it is these attributes that are applied when a match 
 occurs.<BR><BR>
 The configuration process begins with defining one or more 
 match criteria for a class.  
 Then one or more classes are added to a policy.  
 Policies are then added to interfaces.<BR><BR>
 Packet processing begins by testing the match criteria for a packet.  
 The 'all' class type option defines that each match criteria within a class 
 must evaluate to true for a packet to match that class. The 'any' class type
 option defines that at least one match criteria must evaluate to true for
 a packet to match that class.  Classes are tested in the order in which
 they were added to the policy.  A policy is applied to a
 packet when a class match within that policy is found.</P>
