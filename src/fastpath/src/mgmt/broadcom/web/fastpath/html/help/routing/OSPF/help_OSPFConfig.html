<EMWEB_IF ID=USMWEB_IF_READWRITE>
<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Router ID</b> - The 32 bit integer in dotted decimal format that uniquely identifies
      the router within the OSPF domain. If you want to
      change the Router ID you must first disable OSPF.
      After you set the new Router ID, you must re-enable OSPF to have the change take effect.
      The default value is 0.0.0.0, although this is not a valid Router ID.
  <li><b>OSPF Admin State</b> - Select Enable or Disable from the pull down menu.
      If you select Enable OSPF will be activated for the switch.
      The default value is Enable.  You must configure a Router ID
      before OSPF can become operational.  </li>
  <li><b>RFC 1583 Compatibility</b> - Select Enable or Disable from the pull down menu to
      specify the preference rules that will be used when choosing
      among multiple AS-external-LSAs advertising the same destination.
      If you select Enable, the preference rules will be those
      defined by RFC 1583.  If you select Disable, the preference rules will be those defined in
      Section 16.4.1 of RFC 2328. The newer preference rules
      prevent routing loops when AS-external-LSAs for
      the same destination have been originated from different areas.  The default value is Enable.
      All routers in the OSPF domain must be configured the same. If all OSPF routers
      are capable of operating according to RFC 2328, RFC 1583 Compatibility should be disabled.
      </li>
  <li><b>Opaque LSA Status</b> - Set this parameter to Enable to if OSPF should
      store and flood opaque LSAs. The default value is Enable. An opaque LSA is used for flooding user-defined
      information within an OSPF router domain. </li>
  <li><b>Exit Overflow Interval(secs)</b> - When the number of non-default external LSAs exceeds
      a configured limit, the router enters an overflow state as defined in RFC 1765. The
      Exit Overflow Interval specifies how long OSPF must wait before attempting to
      leave overflow state. The default interval is 0 seconds.  In overflow state, OSPF cannot originate non-default external
      LSAs. If the Exit Overflow Interval is 0, OSPF will not leave overflow state until
      it is disabled and re-enabled. The range is 0 to 2,147,483,647 seconds. </li>

  <li><b>SPF DelayTime(secs)</b> - Delay time is the number of seconds from
      when OSPF receives a topology change to the start of the next SPF calculation.
      Delay Time is an integer from 0 to 65535 seconds. The default time is 5 seconds. A value of 0
      means that there is no delay; that is, the SPF calculation is started upon a topology
      change.

  <li><b>SPF HoldTime(secs)</b> - Hold Time is the minimum time in seconds between two
      consecutive SPF calculations. The range is 0 to 65,535 seconds. The default time is 10 seconds.
      A value of 0 means that there is no delay; that is, two SPF calculations can be done, one immediately
      after the other.

  <li><b>External LSDB Limit</b> - The maximum number of External LSAs that can be stored in the database.
       Default value for limit is -1. A value of -1 indicates there is no limit. The valid range of values is
             <EMWEB_STRING C='
              return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(L7_OSPF_EXT_LSDB_LIMIT_MIN, L7_OSPF_EXT_LSDB_LIMIT_MAX);
              ' >.
  </li>

  <li><b>Default Metric</b> - Sets a default for the metric of redistributed routes.
      This field is 0 if a default metric has not been configured. The range of valid values is
      <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(L7_OSPF_DEFAULT_METRIC_MIN, L7_OSPF_DEFAULT_METRIC_MAX);
       ' >.
  </li>
  <li><b>Maximum Paths</b> - Configure the maximum number of paths that OSPF can report to a
      given destination. Default value is 4. The range of valid values is
      <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(1, L7_RT_MAX_EQUAL_COST_ROUTES);
       ' >.
  </li>
  <li><b>AutoCost Reference Bandwidth</b> - Configure the auto-cost reference-bandwidth to
      control how OSPF calculates link cost. Specify the reference bandwidth in
      megabits per second. Unless a link cost is configured, the link cost
      is computed by dividing the reference bandwidth by the interface bandwidth.
      Default value is 100. The range is
       <EMWEB_STRING C='
       return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp( L7_OSPF_MIN_REF_BW, L7_OSPF_MAX_REF_BW);
       ' >.
       </li>

  <li><b>Default Passive Setting</b> - Configure the global passive mode setting for
      all OSPF interfaces. Configuring this field overwrites any present interface level
      passive mode setting. OSPF does not form adjacencies on passive interfaces, but
      does advertise attached networks as stub networks. Default is Disable.
      </li>

  <h4>Default Route Advertise</h4>

  <li><b>Default Information Originate</b> - When this parameter is enabled, OSPF
      originates an external LSA advertising a default route (0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0). It has
      to be enabled to be able to configure Always, Metric and Metric Type attributes. Default is Disable.</li>
  <li><b>Always</b> - If Default Information Originate is enabled, but the Always option
      is FALSE, OSPF will only originate a default route if the router already has a default
      route in its routing table. Set Always to TRUE to force OSPF to originate a default
      route regardless of whether the router has a default route. Default is False.</li>
  <li><b>Metric</b> - Specifies the metric of the default route. Default value is 0. 0 specifies that nothing has been configured.   The range of valid values is
  <EMWEB_STRING C='
      return usmWebIntegerRangeHelp(L7_OSPF_DEFAULT_RT_ADVERTISE_METRIC_MIN, L7_OSPF_DEFAULT_RT_ADVERTISE_METRIC_MAX);
       ' >
  </li>
  <li><b>Metric Type</b> - Sets the OSPF metric type of the default route. Default value is External Type 2.</li>

    <li><b>Helper Support Mode</b> - Configures how unit will act when a 
neighbor performs a warm restart. The possible values are:
      <ul type="square">
        <li><i><b>Planned</b></i> - Indicates that OSPF should only 
            help a restarting neighbor during planned events.
            </li>
        <li><i><b>Always</b></i> - Indicates that OSPF help a restarting 
            neighbor during all planned and unplanned warm restart events.</li>
        <li><i><b>Disabled</b></i> - Disables OSPF from acting as a helpful 
            neighbor.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Helper Strict LSA Checking</b> - When enabled, the unit will exit
helper mode whenever the topology changes.
    </li>
<EMWEB_ELSE>
