<P>The Multicast Forwarding Database holds the port membership information for all active multicast
address entries.
The key for an entry consists of a VLAN ID and MAC address pair.
Entries may contain data for more than one protocol.</P>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>
                                                      
<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>MAC Address</b> -
      Enter the VLAN ID - MAC Address pair whose MFDB table entry you want displayed.
      Enter eight two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated 
         by colons, for example 00:01:23:43:45:67:89:AB.  The first two two-digit
         hexadecimal numbers are the VLAN ID and the remaining numbers are the MAC address. 
         Then click on the "Search" button.
         If the address exists, that entry will be displayed.  An exact match is required. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>MAC Address</b> -
      The multicast MAC address for which you requested data.  </li>
  
  <li><b>Component</b> - This is the component that is responsible for this entry in the Multicast 
         Forwarding Database.  Possible values are IGMP Snooping, MLD Snooping, GMRP, and Static Filtering.                                 
  </li>
  <li><b>Type</b> - 
         This displays the type of the entry. Static entries are those that are configured
         by the end user.  Dynamic entries are added to the table as a result of a learning process
         or protocol.           
  </li>

  <li><b>Description</b> - The text description of this multicast table entry. Possible values
  are Management Configured, Network Configured and Network Assisted.                                
  </li>
  <li><b>Interface(s)</b> - The list of interfaces that are designated for 
  forwarding (Fwd:) for the selected address.                                 
  </li>
  <li><b>Forwarding Interface(s)</b> - The resultant forwarding list is derived from combining 
  all the forwarding interfaces and removing the interfaces that are listed as the static 
         filtering interfaces.                      
  </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

                 
<h3>Command Buttons</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Search</b> - Searches for VLAN ID - MAC Address pair whose MFDB table entry you want displayed.</li>
  <li><b>Refresh</b> - Refresh
      the data on the screen with the present state of the data in the switch. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
