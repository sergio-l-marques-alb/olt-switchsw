 <h2><a name=dvmrpintfparams></a>Help for DVMRP Interface Summary</h2>

 <h3>Selection Criteria </h3>

 <ul type=disc>
  <ul type=circle>
   <li><b>Interface</b> - Select the interface for which data is to be displayed.
   You must configure at least one router interface before you
     can display data for a DVMRP interface.  Otherwise you will see a message
      telling you that no router interfaces are available, and the configuration summary
      screen will not be displayed.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
 <h4>Interface Parameters</h4>
  <li><b>Interface Mode </b> - The administrative mode of the selected DVMRP routing interface,
  either enable or disable.</li>
     <li><b>Protocol State</b> - The operational state of the DVMRP protocol on the selected interface,
  either operational or non-operational.</li>
  <li><b>Local Address </b> - The IP address used as a source address in packets sent from the
            selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Interface Metric</b> - The metric used to calculate distance vectors for the selected interface.</li>
 <h4>Interface Statistics</h4>
  <li><b>Generation ID </b> - The DVMRP generation ID used by the router for the selected interface.</li>
  This value is reset every time an interface is (re)started and is placed in prune messages.
  A change in generation ID informs
  the neighbor routers that any previous information about this router should be discarded.</li>
  <li><b>Received Bad Packets </b> - The number of invalid packets received on the selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Received Bad Routes </b> - The number of invalid routes received on the selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Sent Routes </b> - The number of routes sent on the selected interface.</li>
 <h4>Neighbor Parameters</h4>
  <li><b>Neighbor IP </b> - The IP address of the neighbor whose information is 
      to be displayed. This field appears on the page only when there are finite
      number of neighbors.</li>
  <li><b>State </b> - The state of the specified neighbor router on the selected interface,
  either active or down.</li>
  <li><b>Neighbor Uptime </b> - The DVMRP uptime for the specified neighbor on the selected interface.
  This is the time since the neighbor entry was learned.</li>
  <li><b>Neighbor Expiry Time</b> - The DVMRP expiry time for the specified neighbor on the selected interface.
  This is the time left before this neighbor entry will age out, and is not applicable if the neighbor
  router's state is down.</li>
  <li><b>Generation ID </b> - The DVMRP generation ID for the specified neighbor on the selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Major Version </b> - The DVMRP Major Version for the specified neighbor on the selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Minor Version </b> - The DVMRP Minor Version for the specified neighbor on the selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Capabilities </b> - The DVMRP capabilities of the specified neighbor on the selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Received Routes </b> - The number of routes received for the specified neighbor on the selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Received Bad Packets </b> - The number of invalid packets received for the specified neighbor on the selected interface.</li>
  <li><b>Received Bad Routes </b> - The number of invalid routes received for the specified neighbor on the selected interface.</li>
  </ul>
