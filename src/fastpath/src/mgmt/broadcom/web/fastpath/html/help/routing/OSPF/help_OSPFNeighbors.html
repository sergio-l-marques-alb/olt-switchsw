<h2><a name=nbr_dt></a>Help for OSPF Neighbors </h2>

This screen displays the OSPF neighbor information for a selected neighbor ID. 
When a particular neighbor ID is specified, detailed information about a neighbor 
is given. The information below will only be displayed if OSPF is enabled and the interface 
has a neighbor. The IP address is the IP address of the neighbor.

<h3>Selection Criteria </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Neighbor IP Address</b> -
      Selects the IP Address of the neighbor for which data is to be
      displayed.</li>    
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Router ID</b> - A 32 bit integer in dotted decimal format that identifies the neighbor router.
      </li>
  <li><b>Options</b> - The optional OSPF capabilities supported by the neighbor.
        The neighbor's optional OSPF capabilities are also listed in its
        Hello packets.  This enables received Hello Packets to be
        rejected (i.e., neighbor relationships will not even start to
        form) if there is a mismatch in certain crucial OSPF
        capabilities. 
 </li>
  <li><b>Router Priority</b> - Displays the OSPF priority for the specified neighbor. 
        The priority of a neighbor is a priority integer from 0 to 255. A value
        of '0' indicates that the router is not eligible to become the
        designated router on this network. </li>
  <li><b>State</b> - The state of a neighbor can be the following:
      <ul type=square>
         <li><I><b>Down</b></I> - This is the initial state of a neighbor conversation.  It
            indicates that there has been no recent information received
            from the neighbor.  On NBMA networks, Hello packets may
            still be sent to "Down" neighbors, although at a reduced
            frequency. </li>
         <li><I><b>Attempt</b></I> - This state is only valid for neighbors attached to NBMA
            networks.  It indicates that no recent information has been
            received from the neighbor, but that a more concerted effort
            should be made to contact the neighbor.  This is done by
            sending the neighbor Hello packets at intervals of
            Hello Interval. </li>
         <li><I><b>Init</b></I> - In this state, a Hello packet has recently been seen from
            the neighbor.  However, bidirectional communication has not
            yet been established with the neighbor (i.e., the router
            itself did not appear in the neighbor's Hello packet).  All
            neighbors in this state (or greater) are listed in the Hello
            packets sent from the associated interface.</li>
         <li><I><b>2-Way</b></I> - In this state, communication between the two routers is
            bidirectional.  This has been assured by the operation of
            the Hello Protocol.  This is the most advanced state short
            of beginning adjacency establishment.  The (Backup)
            Designated Router is selected from the set of neighbors in
            state 2-Way or greater. </li>
         <li><I><b>Exchange Start</b></I> - This is the first step in creating an adjacency between the
            two neighboring routers.  The goal of this step is to decide
            which router is the master, and to decide upon the initial
            DD sequence number.  Neighbor conversations in this state or
            greater are called adjacencies. </li>
         <li><I><b>Exchange</b></I> - In this state the router is describing its entire link state
            database by sending Database Description packets to the
            neighbor.  In this state, Link State Request Packets may
            also be sent asking for the neighbor's more recent LSAs.
            All adjacencies in Exchange state or greater are used by the
            flooding procedure.  These adjacencies are fully
            capable of transmitting and receiving all types of OSPF
            routing protocol packets. </li>
         <li><I><b>Loading</b></I> - In this state, Link State Request packets are sent to the
            neighbor asking for the more recent LSAs that have been
            discovered (but not yet received) in the Exchange state. </li>
         <li><I><b>Full</b></I> - In this state, the neighboring routers are fully adjacent.
            These adjacencies will now appear in router-LSAs and
            network-LSAs.</li>
      </ul>      
      </li>
  <li><b>Events</b> - The number of times this neighbor relationship has changed state, or an error has occurred. </li>
  <li><b>Permanence</b> - This variable displays the status of the entry.  'dynamic' and 'permanent' refer to how the neighbor became known.</li>
  <li><b>Hellos Suppressed</b> - This indicates whether Hellos are being suppressed to the neighbor. </li>
  <li><b>Retransmission Queue Length</b> - The current length of the retransmission queue.</li>
  <li><b>Up Time</b> - The Up Time of the OSPF neighbor, which says how long the neighbor is active.</li>
  <li><b>Restart Helper Status</b> - The status of a helpful neighbor can be the following:
      <ul type=square>
         <li><I><b>Not Restarting</b></I> -  The neighbor is not restarting.</li>
         <li><I><b>Planned Restart</b></I> - The neighbor is restarting due to a user initiated failover.</li>
         <li><I><b>Unplanned Restart</b></I> - The neighbor is restarting due to an unplanned failover.</li>
      </ul>      
  </li>
  <li><b>Restart Reason</b> - The reason for the last restart.</li>
  <li><b>Remaining Grace Time</b> - The number of seconds remaining in the current graceful restart interval. 
This row is only included if the router is currently acting as a restart helper for the neighbor.</li>
  <li><b>Restart Helper Exit Reason</b> - The reason behind the last restart of the a helpful neighbor can be the following:
      <ul type=square>
         <li><I><b>None</b></I> - Graceful restart has not been attempted. </li>
         <li><I><b>In Progress</b></I> - Restart is in progress.</li>
         <li><I><b>Completed</b></I> - The previous graceful restart completed successfully.</li>
         <li><I><b>Timed Out</b></I> - The previous graceful restart timed out.</li>
         <li><I><b>Topology Changed</b></I> - The previous graceful restart terminated prematurely because of a topology change.</li>
      </ul>      
  </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
