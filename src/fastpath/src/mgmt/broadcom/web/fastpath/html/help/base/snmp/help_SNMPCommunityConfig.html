<h2><a name=snmpcomm></a>Help for SNMP Community Configuration</h2>

<EMWEB_IF ID=USMWEB_IF_READWRITE>
<p><br>
By default, two SNMP Communities exist:
<UL TYPE=disc>
 <li>private, with 'Read/Write' privileges and status set to enable</LI>
 <li>public, with 'Read Only' privileges and status set to enable</LI>
</UL>

<P>These are well-known communities, you can use this menu to change the defaults or to add 
other communities.
Only the communities that you define using this menu will
have access to the switch using the SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c protocols. 
Only those communities
with read-write level access will have access to this menu via SNMP. </P>

<p>
You should use this menu when you are using the SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c protocol: if you want to use
SNMP v3 you should use the User Accounts menu.</P>


<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
   <LI><B>Community Selector</B> -
     Displays default and configured SNMP community configuration. 
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li ><b>Community</b>
      - You can use this screen to reconfigure an existing community, or to create a new one. 
      Use this pull down menu to select one of the existing community names,
      or select 'Create' to add a new one.
      A valid entry
      is a case-sensitive string of up to 16 characters. 
       </li>
  <li><b>Client IP Address</b>
      - Taken together, the Client IP Address and Client IP Mask denote a range of 
      IP addresses from which SNMP clients may use that community to access this 
      device. If either (IP Address or IP Mask) value is 0.0.0.0, access is allowed from any IP address. 
      Otherwise, every client's IP address is ANDed (AND operation) with the mask, as is the Client 
      IP Address, and, if the values are equal, access is allowed.  For example, 
      if the Client IP Address and Client IP Mask parameters are 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0, 
      then any client whose IP address is 192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255 (inclusive) 
      will be allowed access.  To allow access from only one station, use a Client IP 
      Mask value of 255.255.255.255, and use that machine's IP address for Client IP Address.
      </li>
  <li><b>Client IP Mask</b>
      - Taken together, the Client IP Address and Client IP Mask denote a range of 
      IP addresses from which SNMP clients may use that community to access this 
      device. If either (IP Address or IP Mask) value is 0.0.0.0, access is allowed from any IP address. 
      Otherwise, every client's IP address is ANDed (AND operation) with the mask, as is the Client 
      IP Address, and, if the values are equal, access is allowed.  For example, 
      if the Client IP Address and Client IP Mask parameters are 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0, 
      then any client whose IP address is 192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255 (inclusive) 
      will be allowed access.  To allow access from only one station, use a Client IP 
      Mask value of 255.255.255.255, and use that machine's IP address for Client IP Address.
      </li>
  <li><b>Access Mode</b> -
      Specify the access level for this community by selecting
      Read/Write or Read Only from the pull down menu.  </li>
  <li><b>Status</b> - Specify the status of this community by selecting
      Enable or Disable from the pull down menu.
      If you select enable, 
      the Community Name must be unique among all valid Community Names or the
      set request will be rejected. 
      If you select disable, the Community Name will become invalid.
