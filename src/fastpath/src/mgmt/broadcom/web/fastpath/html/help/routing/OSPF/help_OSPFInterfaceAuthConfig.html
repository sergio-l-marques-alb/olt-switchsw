<h2><a name=ospfintfcfg></a>Help for OSPF Interface Configuration</h2>

<h3>Selection Criteria </h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>emweb:/USMWEB_UNIT_SLOT_PORT_DISPLAY;</b> -
      Select the interface for which data is to be displayed or
      configured.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>OSPF Admin Mode</b> - You may select enable or disable from the pull-down menu.
      The default value is 'disable.'
      You can configure OSPF parameters without enabling OSPF Admin Mode,
      but they will have no effect until you enable Admin Mode.
      The following information will be displayed only
      if the Admin Mode is enabled: State, Designated Router, Backup
      Designated Router, Number of Link Events, LSA Ack Interval, and Metric Cost.
      For OSPF to be fully functional, you must enter
      a valid IP Address and Subnet Mask
      via the Interface IP Configuration page or through the CLI command:
      config ip interface network <emweb:/USMWEB_UNIT_SLOT_PORT_DISPLAY;> <ipaddr> <subnet mask>.
      </li>
  <li><b>OSPF Area ID</b> - Enter the area ID of the area to which the selected router
        interface connects.  The area ID may be specified as an integer or in dotted
  decimal notation.If you assign an area ID for an area which does not yet exist,
  the area is created with default values. </li>
  <li><b>Router Priority</b> - Enter the OSPF priority for the selected interface.
        The priority is an integer from 0 to 255.
        The default is 1, which is the highest router priority.  OSPF uses priority
  to select a designated router on a LAN. A value
        of 0 indicates that the router is not eligible to become the
        designated router.</li>
  <li><b>Retransmit Interval</b> - Enter the OSPF retransmit interval in seconds.
        OSPF retransmits link state advertisements when a neighbor does not
  acknowledge receipt. This value is also used when
        retransmitting database descriptions and link-state request packets.
        Valid values range from 1 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).  The default
        is 5 seconds. </li>
 <li><b>Hello Interval</b> - Enter the OSPF hello interval in seconds.  This parameter must
        be the same for all routers on the attached network.  Valid values range
        from 1 to 65,535 seconds.  The default is 10 seconds.  </li>
  <li><b>Dead Interval</b> - Enter the OSPF dead interval in seconds.
        The dead interval is long a router will wait for a neighbor router's
        Hello packets before declaring that the router is down.
        This parameter must be the same for all routers on the attached
        network.  This value should a multiple of the
        Hello Interval (e.g. 4). Valid values range from 1 to 2,147,483,647 seconds.
        The default is 40 seconds. </li>
  <li><b>Transmit Delay</b> - Enter the OSPF Transmit Delay in seconds.
        The interface transmit delay estimates the time it
        takes to transmit a link state update packet over the selected interface.
        Valid values range from 1 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
        The default value is 1 second. </li>

  <li><b>MTU Ignore</b> - Disables OSPF MTU mismatch detection on received database description packets.
        Default value is Disable (MTU mismatch detection is enabled).</li>

  <li><b>Passive Mode</b> - Make an interface passive to prevent OSPF from forming an
        adjacency on an interface. OSPF advertises networks attached to passive
  interfaces as stub networks. Interfaces are not passive by default. </li>

  <li><b>Network Type</b> - Sets the OSPF network type on the interface to broadcast or
        point-to-point. OSPF only selects a designated router and originates network
  LSAs for broadcast networks. No more than two OSPF routers may be present on a
  point-to-point link. The default network type for Ethernet interfaces is broadcast. </li>

  <li><b>Authentication Type</b> - You may select an authentication type other than
        none by clicking on the 'Configure' button.
        You will then see a new screen, where you can select the authentication type from the pull-down menu.
        The choices are:
        <ul type=square>
         <li><I><b>None</b></I> - This is the initial interface state.  If you select
         this option from the pull-down menu on the second screen you will be returned to the
         first screen and no authentication protocols will be run.</LI>
         <LI><i><B>Simple</b></I></li> - If you select 'Simple' you will be prompted to enter
         an authentication key. This key will be included, in the clear, in the OSPF header of
         all packets sent on the network.  All routers on the network must be configured with
         the same key. </LI>
         <LI><i><B>Encrypt</B></I> - If you select 'Encrypt' you will be prompted to enter both an
         authentication key and an authentication ID. Encryption uses the MD5 Message-Digest algorithm.
         All routers on the network must be configured with
         the same key and ID.</LI>
        </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Authentication Key</b> - Enter the OSPF Authentication Key
        for the specified interface. If you do not choose to use authentication
        you will not be prompted to enter a key.  If you choose 'simple' authentication
        you cannot use a key of more than 8 octets. If you choose 'encrypt' the key may be
        up to 16 octets long.
        The key value will only be displayed if you are logged on with
         Read/Write privileges, otherwise it will be displayed as asterisks.  </li>
<LI><B>Authentication ID</B> - Enter the ID to be used for authentication.  You will only
        be prompted to enter an ID when you select 'Encrypt' as the authentication type.
        The ID is a number between 0 ad 255, inclusive.
   <li><b>Metric Cost</b> - Enter the link cost. OSPF uses this value in
        computing shortest paths. The range is from 1 to 65,535.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>IP Address</b> - The IP address of the interface. </li>
  <li><b>Subnet Mask</b> - The network mask, indicating
      the portion of the IP address that identifies the attached network.
      </li>
  <li><b>LSA Ack Interval</b> - The number of seconds to wait before sending
       a delayed acknowledgement. </li>
  <li><b>State</b> - The current state of the selected router interface.  One of:
         <ul type=square>
         <li><I><b>Down</b></I> - This is the initial interface state.  In this state, the
            lower-level protocols have indicated that the interface is
            unusable.  In this state, interface
            parameters will be set to their initial values.  All
            interface timers will be disabled, and there will be no
            adjacencies associated with the interface. </li>
         <li><b><I>Loopback</I></b> - In this state, the router's interface to the network is
            looped back either in hardware
            or software.  The interface is unavailable for regular
            data traffic.  However, it may still be desirable to gain
            information on the quality of this interface, either through
            sending ICMP pings to the interface or through something
            like a bit error test.  For this reason, IP packets may
            still be addressed to an interface in Loopback state.  To
            facilitate this, such interfaces are advertised in router-
            LSAs as single host routes, whose destination is the IP
            interface address. </li>
         <li><b><I>Waiting</I></b> - The router is trying to determine the
            identity of the (Backup) Designated Router for the network by
            monitoring received Hello Packets.  The router is not allowed to elect a Backup
            Designated Router or a Designated Router until it
            transitions out of Waiting state.  This prevents unnecessary
            changes of (Backup) Designated Router. </li>
         <li><b><I>Designated Router</I></b> - This router is itself the Designated Router
            on the attached network.  Adjacencies are established to all
            other routers attached to the network.  The router must also
            originate a network-LSA for the network node.  The network-
            LSA will contain links to all routers (including the
            Designated Router itself) attached to the network.  </li>
         <li><b><I>Backup Designated Router</I></b> - This router is itself the Backup Designated
            Router on the attached network.  It will be promoted to
            Designated Router if the present Designated Router fails.
The router establishes adjacencies to all other routers
            attached to the network.  The Backup Designated Router
            performs slightly different functions during LSA flooding,
      as compared to the Designated Router. </li>
         <li><b><I>Other Designated Router</I></b> - The interface is connected to a broadcast
            network on which other routers have been selected to be the Designated
            Router and Backup Designated Router.  The router attempts to form
            adjacencies to both the Designated Router and the Backup
            Designated Router.</li></b>
    </ul>
    The State is only displayed if the OSPF admin mode is enabled.
    </li>
  <li><b>Designated Router</b> - The identity of the Designated Router for
      this network, in the view of the advertising router.  The Designated
      Router is identified here by its router ID.
      The value 0.0.0.0 means that there is no Designated Router.
      This field is only displayed if the OSPF admin mode is enabled.</li>
  <li><b>Backup Designated Router</b> - The identity of the Backup Designated
      Router for this network, in the view of the advertising router.  The
      Backup Designated Router is identified here by its router ID.
      Set to 0.0.0.0 if there is no Backup Designated Router.
      This field is only displayed if the OSPF admin mode is enabled.</li>
  <li><b>Local Link LSAs</b> - The number of opaque LSAs whose flooding scope
      is the link on this interface.</li>
  <li><b>Link Local LSA Checksums</b> - The sum of the checksums of local link
      LSAs for this link.</li>
  <li><b>Number of Link Events</b> - This is the number of times the specified
      OSPF interface has changed its state. This field is only displayed if the
      OSPF admin mode is enabled.</li>
 </ul>
