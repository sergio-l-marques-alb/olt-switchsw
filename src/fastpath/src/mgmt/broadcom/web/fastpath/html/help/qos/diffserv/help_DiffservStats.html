<h2><a name=servStats></a>Help for Differentiated Services Service Statistics</h2>

 This screen displays service-level statistical information in tabular form for all interfaces in 
 the system to which a DiffServ policy has been attached.  
 Use the 'Counter Mode Selector' to specify the counter display mode as either octets or packets.
        
<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
                                                      
<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Counter Mode Selector</b> - Specifies the format of the displayed counter values, 
         which must be either Octets or Packets.  The default is 'Octets'. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Interface</b> - Shows the Interface that uniquely specifies an interface. </li>
  <li><b>Direction</b> - Shows traffic direction for this service interface.</li>
  <li><b>Operational Status</b> - Shows the operational status of this service interface, either Up or Down. </li>
  <li><b>Offered Packets/Octets</b> - A count of the total number of packets/octets offered to all class instances in this 
         service policy before their defined DiffServ treatment is applied.  This is the overall count 
         per-interface, per-direction. </li>
  <li><b>Discarded Packets/Octets</b> - A count of the total number of packets/octets discarded for all class instances in this
         service policy for any reason due to DiffServ treatment.  This is the overall count 
         per-interface, per-direction. </li>
  <li><b>Sent Packets/Octets</b> - A count of the total number of packets/octets forwarded for all class instances in this
         service policy after their defined DiffServ treatments were applied.  In this case, forwarding 
         means the traffic stream was passed to the next functional element in the data path, such
         as the switching or routing function of an outbound link transmission element.  This is the 
         overall count per-interface, per-direction. </li>
 </ul>
</ul>
