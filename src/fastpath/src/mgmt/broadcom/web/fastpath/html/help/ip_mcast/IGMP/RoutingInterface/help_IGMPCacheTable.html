<h3>Selection Criteria</h3>
<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Multicast Group IP</b> - Select the IP multicast group address for which data is to be displayed. If
      no group membership reports have been received on the selected interface you cannot make this
      selection, and none of the data on this page displays. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Interface</b> - Select the interface for which data is to be displayed.
  </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Configurable Data</h3>

<ul type=disc>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li><b>Last Reporter</b> - The IP address of the source of the last membership report received for the IP
Multicast group address on the selected interface.
  </li>

  <li><b>Up Time</b> - The time elapsed (in hh:mm:ss) since this entry was created.
  </li>
      
  <li><b>Expiry Time</b> - Cache timer value,which indicates the remaining lifetime (in hh:mm:ss) for each entry.
  </li>
      
  <li><b>Version 1 Host Timer</b> - 
The time (in hh:mm:ss) remaining until the local router assumes that there are no
longer any IGMP version 1 members on the IP subnet attached to this interface. When an IGMPv1
membership report is received, this timer is reset to the group membership timer. While this timer
is non-zero, the local router ignores any IGMPv2 leave messages for this group that it receives on
the selected interface. This field is displayed only if the interface is configured for IGMP version 1.
  </li>
      
  <li><b>Version 2 Host Timer</b> - 
    The time (in hh:mm:ss) remaining until the local router 
assumes that there are no longer any IGMP version 2 members on the IP subnet 
attached to this interface. When an IGMPv2 membership report is received, this 
timer is reset to the group membership timer. While this timer
is non-zero, the local router ignores any IGMPv1 and IGMPv3 leave messages for this group that it
receives on the selected interface. This field is displayed only if the interface is configured for
IGMP version 2.
  </li>
  <li><b>Compatibility</b> - 
This parameter shows group compatibility mode (v1, v2 and v3) for this group on
the specified interface.
  </li>
