The
.I snmpinfo.dat
file is used by the SNMP entities, usually SNMP managers, for
translating the English names of MIB variables to the corresponding
numeric OIDs.
.PP
The
.I snmpinfo.dat
file should be located in the manager's configuration directory.
The default is /etc/srconf/mgr/, but may be changed by the environment
variable SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.

The
.I snmpinfo.dat
file is generated by the MIB compiler and should not be edited by hand.

flag to the MIB compiler.
