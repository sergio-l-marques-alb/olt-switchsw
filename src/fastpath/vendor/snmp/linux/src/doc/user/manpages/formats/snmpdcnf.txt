NAME
     snmpd.cnf - the SNMP agent configuration


SYNOPSIS
     TAG VALUE


DESCRIPTION
     The configuration file snmpd.cnf is  required  by  the  SNMP
     agent  entities  to  supply initial values for MIB-II system
     group variables, to configure authentication-failure  traps,
     to  configure  which  managers  should receive traps, and to
     authorize  SNMPv1/SNMPv2C  community  strings  and   SNMPv2*
     users.

     The default location of snmpd.cnf is

         /etc/srconf/agt/                     Most UNIX Systems
         /etc/SnmpAgent.d/                    HP/UX
         /home/vxworks/snmp-dev/config/agt/   VxWorks
         \ETC\SRCONF\AGT\ (current drive)     MS-DOS

     but this location can be changed by assigning the full path-
     name   of   a   directory   to   the   environment  variable
     SR_AGT_CONF_DIR.

     The format of snmpd.cnf is:

     TAG VALUE

     Where TAG is one of

         acEntry                 sysContact
         community               sysDescr
         communityEntry          sysLocation
         MAX_OUTPUT_WAITING      sysName
         MAX_PDU_TIME            sysObjectID
         MAX_SUBAGENTS           transportEntry
         MAX_THREADS             trap
         notifyEntry             userNameEntry
         snmpBoots               v2ContextEntry
         snmpEnableAuthenTraps   viewTreeEntry


     and VALUE is a valid value for the given key.

     The set of legal tags is different for agents which  do  and
     do not support SNMPv2*, and some tags apply only to EMANATE.
     A tag which is not recognized by an agent is ignored.  White
     space  (tabs, spaces, line-feeds/carriage-returns) and blank

  System Variable Initialization
     When the TAG is one of the MIB-II system group variables

           sysContact
           sysDescr
           sysLocation
           sysName
           sysObjectID
           snmpEnableAuthenTraps

     that variable will be initialized  to  VALUE.  According  to
     RFC1213,  the  variables  sysContact, sysDescr, sysLocation,
     and sysName can be any string of 0 to 255 NVT ASCII  charac-
     ters,   sysObjectID  is  an  object  identifier  (OID),  and
     snmpEnableAuthenTraps can be either

         1 to enable traps

     or

         2 to disable traps.


  Agents that Support SNMPv2*
     When the TAG is "userNameEntry," the  format  of  the  VALUE
     clause is:

          userAuthSnmpID userName userGroupName  userTransportLa-
          bel userMemoryType

     where

        + userAuthSnmpID
          is an OctetString, usually localSnmpID.

        + userName
          is the user name in ASCII text.

          is the user's group name in ASCII text.

        + userTransportLabel
          is a transportEntry.

        + viewTreeMask
          is an OctetString represented as a sequence of  hexade-
          cimal  numbers  separated  by  colons.   Each  octet is
          within the  range  0x00  through  0xff  (a  zero-length
          OctetString is represented with a dash (-).

        + viewTreeType
          is  `included'  or  `excluded'  and  indicates  if  the
          viewTreeSubTree  is explicitly accessable or not acces-
          sible in this MIB view.

        + v2ContextMemoryType
          is `nonVolatile', `permanent', or `readOnly'.

        + notifyViewName
          is a MIB view (i.e., viewTreeName value) which will  be
          used to authenticate the trap or inform.

        + notifyMemoryType
          is `nonVolatile', `permanent', or `readOnly'.


     When the TAG is "transportEntry," the format  of  the  VALUE
     clause is:

          transportLabel transportSubIndex transportDomain  tran-
          sportAddress  transportReceiveMask  transportMMS  tran-
          sportMemoryType

     where

        + transportLabel

        + transportSubIndex
          is an integer.

        + transportDomain
          is the transport type,  e.g.,  `snmpUDPDomain'  for  IP
          transport, `snmpIPXDomain' for IPX transport, etc.

          appears in the snmpd.cnf file in the same format as the
          transportAddress. For example,  if  transportDomain  is
          `snmpUDPDomain',     a     valid    mask    would    be
          `255.255.255.0:0'.  This mask is  used  in  conjunction
          with  the transportAddress. to determine if an incoming
          request has arrived from an  authorized  address.   For
          example, if the transportAddress is `192.147.142.254:0'
          and the transportReceiveMask  is  `255.255.255.0:0',  a
          request  from  any  port  on the subnet 192.147.142.xxx
          would not be  rejected  on  the  basis  of  the  source
          address.

        + transportMMS
          is an integer representing  the  maximum  message  size
          capable on this transport.

     When the TAG is "community," the format of the VALUE  clause
     is:

          community-name IP-address privileges community-id

     where

        + community-name
          may be any string.

        + IP-address
          indicates the remote's site for which this community is
          valid.   If  the  IP address is 0.0.0.0,any address may
          communicate using that session name.

        + privileges
          is `READ' for read-only or `WRITE' for read-write.

        + community-id
          is ignored.


     When the TAG is "trap," the format of the VALUE clause is:

          trap-community-name IP-address

     where

     When the TAG is "MAX_PDU_TIME,"  the  format  of  the  VALUE
     clause is:

          time

     where

        + time
          is the maximum length of time in centiseconds that  the
          Master Agent will wait for a PDU to be processed.  This
          is equivalent to the amount of  time  that  the  Master
          Agent  will  wait for a response from a Subagent before
          the Subagent times out.  If this value  is  not  speci-
          fied, the default is 2500.


     When the TAG is "MAX_SUBAGENTS," the  format  of  the  VALUE
     clause is:

          number

     where

        + number
          is the maximum number of Subagents which  can  be  con-
          nected  to  the  Master  Agent.   If  this value is not
          specified, the default is 10.


     When the TAG is  "MAX_THREADS,"  the  format  of  the  VALUE
     clause is:

          number

     where

        + number
          is the maximum number of threads permitted  to  execute
          in  the  Master  Agent.   Since a thread is created for
          each PDU, this is equivalent to the maximum  number  of
          SNMP  requests which can be processed asynchronously in
          the Master Agent.  If this value is not specified,  the
          default is 10.
