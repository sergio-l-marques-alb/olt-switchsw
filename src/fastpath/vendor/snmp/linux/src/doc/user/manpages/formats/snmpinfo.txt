SNMPINFO.DAT(5)           FILE FORMATS            SNMPINFO.DAT(5)



NAME
     snmpinfo.dat - OID configuration for SNMP entities.


SYNOPSIS
     snmpinfo.dat is generated by the MIB compiler and should not
     be edited.


DESCRIPTION
     The snmpinfo.dat file is used by the SNMP entities,  usually
     SNMP  managers,  for  translating  the  English names of MIB
     variables to the corresponding numeric OIDs.

     The snmpinfo.dat file should be  located  in  the  manager's
     configuration  directory.   The default is /etc/srconf/mgr/,
     but   may   be   changed   by   the   environment   variable
     SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.

     The snmpinfo.dat file is generated by the MIB  compiler  and
     should  not be edited by hand.  New MIB variable translation
     information can be added to the existing  snmpinfo.dat  file
     using the -mergeinfo flag to the MIB compiler.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Cannot translate MIB variable:
          This message indicates that the snmpinfo.dat file  does
          not  contain  OID translation information for the indi-
          cated MIB variable's English name.

     Failure in snmpinfo.dat
          This message indicates that there is a problem with the
          configuration  file.   Check  to  see  that there is an
          snmpinfo.dat file located in the default  directory  or
          in  the directory indicated by the environment variable
          SR_MGR_CONF_DIR.  If the file exists, ensure  that  the
          file is readable and contains the correct information.
