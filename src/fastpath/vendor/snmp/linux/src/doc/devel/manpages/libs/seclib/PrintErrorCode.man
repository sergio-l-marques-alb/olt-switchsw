.SH NAME
.HP 10
PrintErrorCode - prints error code received in an SNMP get response.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
void
.br
.BI PrintErrorCode " (error_index, error_status) "
.br
SR_INT32 error_index;
.br
SR_INT32 error_status;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I PrintErrorCode
prints the error code received in a get response
(by a manager utility) to the screen. If pdu_ptr is the pointer
to the SNMP PDU, an example of calling this routine would be:
.IP
 PrintErrorCode(pdu_ptr->u.normpdu.error_index, 
                pdu_ptr->u.normpdu.error_status)
.PP
This routine returns nothing.
.HP 5
The parameter, 
.I error_index, 
indicates which VarBind in the SNMP PDU caused the error.
.HP 5
The parameter, 
.I error_status, 
indicates what error was returned.
.SH EXAMPLES
For an example of how this routine is used, see any of the manager
utilities (e. g., getmany.c).
