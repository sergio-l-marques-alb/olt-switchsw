 * PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:

 * By requirement of license agreement, at least one (1) instance of

 * binary files produced from SNMP Research source code.
 *
 * However, if the combination of Source components yields Software
 * components with multiple identical copyright notices in a single
 * binary image, Licensee may take appropriate actions to suppress the
 * generation of the redundant strings, using the techniques already
 * embedded in the Source, so long as at least one of each unique
 * copyright notice is generated in the Software and all copyright
 * notices are retained in the Source.
 *
 * In order to accomplish this, compile all files with -DNOTICE and
 * either compile the "main" .c file without it or put
 * #undef NOTICE just before the inclusion of this file (sr_snmp.h)
