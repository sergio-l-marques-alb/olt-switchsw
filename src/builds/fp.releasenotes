Fastpath 6.3.0.2 Release Notes
Version 2.8.0-r1415
 - Req OLTSWITCH-253/OLTTS-3980: Integration of MGMD module to Fastpath.
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-266: This has to change places, otherwise "MAP_CPLD"'s not defined, leading to strange behaviours.
 - Req OLTSWITCH-259: Should instead be used an OLT sysID MAC, not this.
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-266: PLD/FPGA accesses should be avoided for boards with no PLD/FPGA.
 - Req OLTSWITCH-259: LACP driven LAGs unavailability above 50ms under matrix commutation (still pending a common LACP sysID for both matrixes).
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-261: Transmitted IGMP/DHCP/PPPoE packets (to leaf ports) should be double-tagged packets for QUATTRO EVCs.
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-260: Multicast EVCs egress rules defined as OVLAN+UNIVLAN.
 - Task OLTSWITCH-256/OLTTS-4261: Explore BCM IP Routing
 - Req OLTSWITCH-185: EVC virtual indexing (extended ids) applied to matrix boards.
 - Task OLTSWITCH-256/OLTTS-4261: L3 Host and Route routines added.
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-255/OLTTS-4260: Service Unicast Unstacked with relay PPPoE sends C-VLAN to Upstream in PPPoE packets.
 - Task OLTSWITCH-48: fastpath.build optimized to compress further the unstripped binaries.
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-252/OLTTS-4140: It is not possible to create a Multicast Group List to a multicast service that have a TA48GE as client interface.
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-251/OLTTS-4139: Mediatype and auto-negotiation status on the TA48 should not appear if there is no SFP on the interface
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-254/OLTTS-4127: The alarm “ End Eth link down” is not registered on WebTI and CLI, when LAG Interface changes to administrative down state.

 - Fix OLTTS-4141: DHCP Client Request and Server Replies Without Options: gubfixes.
 - Fix OLTSWITCH-249/OLTTS-4042: DHCP packets belonging to QUATTRO flows, are not being correctly validated.
