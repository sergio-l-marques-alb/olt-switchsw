 *  MVTEs in the range MCAST_MVT_BASE through MCAST_MVT_BASE +
 *  MCAST_ENTRY_COUNT - 1. It will then manage the MVTEs locally (not through
 *  the QE.  If this is set to one, however, any call that either explicitly or
 *  implicitly requires mcast to allocate an MVT will make a call to the
 *  qe2000_mvt allocation function.
 *
 *  MCAST_NO_FT_LOCAL, if zero allows the mcast module to assume it owns FTEs
 *  in the range MCAST_FT_BASE through MCAST_FT_BASE + MCAST_ENTRY_COUNT - 1.
 *  It will then manage the FTEs locally.  If this is nonzero, it will use the
 *  allocator function to manage the FTEs.  Note that when nonzero, the init
 *  function does not know which L2 entries that have multicast addresses
 *  belong to this module, so init will obliterate all of them (where it will
 *  only remove the addresses that belong to this module when zero).
