# This property must be present for ucode_port properties to be used

#ucode_num_ports.1=1

# The BCM8802X ucode port property values have the form:
#       fport:sysport
# Where ports are of the form:
#       gex.y      GbE ports, x=0,1, y=0-11
#       xex.y      XG/HG ports, x=0,1, y=0
#       spix.y     SPI-4.2 ports, x=0-1, y=0-63
#       pcix       CPU port, x=0
#
# The `fport' is the front-side port, and the `sysport' is the
# system-side port.
# Most system configurations use a QE-2000 CPU port,
# so the PCI port is typically not mapped to a microcode port.
#
# Note that an attached QE-2000 SPI port mapping must be
# `synchronized' with the FE-2000 SPI port mapping to ensure
# consistent SPI port calendars.  If SPI training fails, this
# is typically because the FE & QE have different calendar
# lengths.
